  abstract = {How do we find what we are looking for? Even when the desired target is in the current field of view, we need to search because fundamental limits on visual processing make it impossible to recognize everything at once. Searching involves directing atten- tion to objects that might be the target. This deployment of attention is not random. It is guided to the most promising items and locations by five factors discussed here: bottom-up salience, top-down feature guidance, scene structure and meaning, the pre- vious history of search over timescales ranging from milliseconds to years, and the relative value of the targets and distractors. Modern theories of visual search need to incorporate all five factors and specify how these factors combine to shape search behaviour. An understanding of the rules of guidance can be used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of socially important search tasks, from security screening to medical image perception.},

  title = {Capacity Limitations of Visual Search in Deep Convolutional Neural Network},
  abstract = {Deep convolutional neural networks follow roughly the architecture of biological visual systems, and have shown a performance comparable to human observers in object recognition tasks. In this study, I test a pre-trained deep neural network in some classic visual search tasks. The results reveal a qualitative difference from human performance. It appears that there is no difference between searches for simple features that pop out in experiments with humans, and for feature configurations that exhibit strict capacity limitations in human vision. Both types of stimuli reveal moderate capacity limitations in the neural network tested here.},

The author discusses paradigmatic issues, such as accuracy methods, interpretation of search results, and the description of search performance. The author next describes the properties of preattentive processing, the processing of stimuli that occurs before attention is deployed to an item in a search task. The author then discusses the use of preattentive information by subsequent processes, including stimulus-driven and user-driven processes.
