  abstract = {Fine-grained object classification is a challenging task due to the subtle inter-class difference and large intra-class variation. Recently, visual attention models have been applied to automatically localize the discriminative regions of an image for better capturing critical difference and demonstrated promising performance. However, without consideration of the diversity in attention process, most of existing attention models perform poorly in classifying fine-grained objects. In this paper, we propose a diversified visual attention network (DVAN) to address the problems of fine-grained object classification, which substan- tially relieves the dependency on strongly-supervised information for learning to localize discriminative regions compared with attentionless models. More importantly, DVAN explicitly pursues the diversity of attention and is able to gather discriminative information to the maximal extent. Multiple attention canvases are generated to extract convolutional features for attention. An LSTM recurrent unit is employed to learn the attentiveness and discrimination of attention canvases. The proposed DVAN has the ability to attend the object from coarse to fine granularity, and a dynamic internal representation for classification is built up by incrementally combining the information from different locations and scales of the image. Extensive experiments con- ducted on CUB-2011, Stanford Dogs and Stanford Cars datasets have demonstrated that the proposed diversified visual attention networks achieve competitive performance compared to the state- of-the-art approaches, without using any prior knowledge, user interaction or external resource in training or testing.},

  abstract = {State-of-the-art object detection networks depend on region proposal algorithms to hypothesize object locations. Advances like SPPnet and Fast R-CNN have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features---using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model, our detection system has a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image. In ILSVRC and COCO 2015 competitions, Faster R-CNN and RPN are the foundations of the 1st-place winning entries in several tracks. Code has been made publicly available.},

  abstract = {We pursue a life-long learning approach to artificial intelligence that makes extensive use of reinforcement learning algorithms. We build on our prior work with general value functions (GVFs) and the Horde architecture. GVFs have been shown able to represent a wide variety of facts about the world's dynamics that may be useful to a long-lived agent (Sutton et al. 2011). We have also previously shown scaling - that thousands of on-policy GVFs can be learned accurately in real-time on a mobile robot (Modayil, White \& Sutton 2011). That work was limited in that it learned about only one policy at a time, whereas the greatest potential benefits of life-long learning come from learning about many policies in parallel, as we explore in this paper. Many new challenges arise in this off-policy learning setting. To deal with convergence and efficiency challenges, we utilize the recently introduced GTD(\{\textbackslash{}lambda\}) algorithm. We show that GTD(\{\textbackslash{}lambda\}) with tile coding can simultaneously learn hundreds of predictions for five simple target policies while following a single random behavior policy, assessing accuracy with interspersed on-policy tests. To escape the need for the tests, which preclude further scaling, we introduce and empirically vali- date two online estimators of the off-policy objective (MSPBE). Finally, we use the more efficient of the two estimators to demonstrate off-policy learning at scale - the learning of value functions for one thousand policies in real time on a physical robot. This ability constitutes a significant step towards scaling life-long off-policy learning.},

  abstract = {Visual search is a key paradigm in attention research that has proved to be a test bed for competing theories of selective attention. The starting point for most current theories of visual search has been Treisman's ''feature integration theory'' of visual attention (e.g., Treisman \& Gelade, 1980). A number of key issues that have been raised in attempts to test this theory are still pertinent questions of research today: (1) The role and (mode of) function of bottom-up and top-down mechanisms in controlling or ''guiding'' visual search; (2) in particular, the role and function of implicit and explicit memory mechanisms; (3) the implementation of these mechanisms in the brain; and (4) the simulation of visual search processes in computational or, respectively, neurocomputational (network) models. This paper provides a review of the experimental work and the *often conflicting * theoretical positions on these thematic issues, and goes on to introduce a set of papers by distinguished experts in fields designed to provide solutions to these issues. A key paradigm in attention research, that has proved to be a test bed for competing theories of selective attention, is visual search. In the standard paradigm, the observer is presented with a display that can contain a target stimulus amongst a variable number of distractor stimuli. The total number of stimuli is referred to as the display size. The target is either present or absent, and the observers' task is to make a target-present vs. target-absent decision as rapidly and accurately as possible. (Alternatively, the search display may be presented for a limited exposure duration, and the dependent variable is the accuracy of target detection.) The time taken for these decisions (the reaction time, RT) can be graphed as a function of the display size (search RT functions). An important characteristic of such functions is its slope, that is, the search rate, measured in terms of time per display item. Based on the search RT functions obtained in a variety of search experiments, a distinction has been proposed between two modes of visual},

It is guided to the most promising items and locations by five factors discussed here: bottom-up salience, top-down feature guidance, scene structure and meaning, the pre- vious history of search over timescales ranging from milliseconds to years, and the relative value of the targets and distractors. Modern theories of visual search need to incorporate all five factors and specify how these factors combine to shape search behaviour. An understanding of the rules of guidance can be used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of socially important search tasks, from security screening to medical image perception.},

  abstract = {In recent years, many new cortical areas have been identified in the macaque monkey. The number of identified connections between areas has increased even more dramatically. We report here on (1) a summary of the layout of cortical areas associated with vision and with other modalities, (2) a computerized database for storing and representing large amounts of information on connectivity patterns, and (3) the application of these data to the analysis of hierarchical organization of the cerebral cortex. Our analysis concentrates on the visual system, which includes 25 neocortical areas that are predominantly or exclusively visual in function, plus an additional 7 areas that we regard as visual-association areas on the basis of their extensive visual inputs. A total of 305 connections among these 32 visual and visual-association areas have been reported. This represents 31\% of the possible number of pathways if each area were connected with all others. The actual degree of connectivity is likely to be closer to 40\%. The great majority of pathways involve reciprocal connections between areas. There are also extensive connections with cortical areas outside the visual system proper, including the somatosensory cortex, as well as neocortical, transitional, and archicortical regions in the temporal and frontal lobes. In the somatosensory/motor system, there are 62 identified pathways linking 13 cortical areas, suggesting an overall connectivity of about 40\%. Based on the laminar patterns of connections between areas, we propose a hierarchy of visual areas and of somatosensory/motor areas that is more comprehensive than those suggested in other recent studies. The current version of the visual hierarchy includes 10 levels of cortical processing. Altogether, it contains 14 levels if one includes the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus at the bottom as well as the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus at the top. Within this hierarchy, there are multiple, intertwined processing streams, which, at a low level, are related to the compartmental organization of areas V1 and V2 and, at a high level, are related to the distinction between processing centers in the temporal and parietal lobes. However, there are some pathways and relationships (about 10\% of the total) whose descriptions do not fit cleanly into this hierarchical scheme for one reason or another. In most instances, though, it is unclear whether these represent genuine exceptions to a strict hierarchy rather than inaccuracies or uncertainities in the reported assignment},

  abstract = {Animals execute goal-directed behaviours despite the limited range and scope of their sensors. To cope, they explore environments and store memories maintaining estimates of important information that is not presently available. Recently, progress has been made with artificial intelligence (AI) agents that learn to perform tasks from sensory input, even at a human level, by merging reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms with deep neural networks, and the excitement surrounding these results has led to the pursuit of related ideas as explanations of non-human animal learning. However, we demonstrate that contemporary RL algorithms struggle to solve simple tasks when enough information is concealed from the sensors of the agent, a property called "partial observability". An obvious requirement for handling partially observed tasks is access to extensive memory, but we show memory is not enough; it is critical that the right information be stored in the right format. We develop a model, the Memory, RL, and Inference Network (MERLIN), in which memory formation is guided by a process of predictive modeling. MERLIN facilitates the solution of tasks in 3D virtual reality environments for which partial observability is severe and memories must be maintained over long durations. Our model demonstrates a single learning agent architecture that can solve canonical behavioural tasks in psychology and neurobiology without strong simplifying assumptions about the dimensionality of sensory input or the duration of experiences.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has led to significant advances in artificial intelligence, in part, by adopting strategies motivated by neurophysiology. However, it is unclear whether deep learning could occur in the real brain. Here, we show that a deep learning algorithm that utilizes multi-compartment neurons might help us to understand how the brain optimizes cost functions. Like neocortical pyramidal neurons, neurons in our model receive sensory information and higher-order feedback in electrotonically segregated compartments. Thanks to this segregation, the neurons in different layers of the network can coordinate synaptic weight updates. As a result, the network can learn to categorize images better than a single layer network. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm takes advantage of multilayer architectures to identify useful representations---the hallmark of deep learning. This work demonstrates that deep learning can be achieved using segregated dendritic compartments, which may help to explain the dendritic morphology of neocortical pyramidal neurons.},

  abstract = {There is growing consensus that reward plays an important role in the control of attention. Until recently, reward was thought to influence attention indirectly by modulating task-specific motivation and its effects on voluntary control over selection. Such an account was consistent with the goal-directed (endogenous) versus stimulus-driven (exogenous) framework that had long dominated the field of attention research. Now, a different perspective is emerging. Demonstrations that previously reward-associated stimuli can automatically capture attention even when physically inconspicuous and task-irrelevant challenge previously held assumptions about attentional control. The idea that attentional selection can be value driven, reflecting a distinct and previously unrecognized control mechanism, has gained traction. Since these early demonstrations, the influence of reward learning on attention has rapidly become an area of intense investigation, sparking many new insights. The result is an emerging picture of how the reward system of the brain automatically biases information processing. Here, I review the progress that has been made in this area, synthesizing a wealth of recent evidence to provide an integrated, up-to-date account of value-driven attention and some of its broader implications.},

When trained on one task, then trained on a second task, many machine learning models "forget" how to perform the first task. This is widely believed to be a serious problem for neural networks. Here, we investigate the extent to which the catastrophic forgetting problem occurs for modern neural networks, comparing both established and recent gradient-based training algorithms and activation functions. We also examine the effect of the relationship between the first task and the second task on catastrophic forgetting. We find that it is always best to train using the dropout algorithm--the dropout algorithm is consistently best at adapting to the new task, remembering the old task, and has the best tradeoff curve between these two extremes. We find that different tasks and relationships between tasks result in very different rankings of activation function performance. This suggests the choice of activation function should always be cross-validated.},

The SC both implements the motor consequences of attention and plays a crucial role in the process of target selection that precedes movement. Moreover, even in the absence of overt orienting movements, SC activity is related to shifts of covert attention and is necessary for the normal control of spatial attention during perceptual judgments. The neuronal circuits that link the SC to spatial attention may include attention-related areas of the cerebral cortex, but recent results show that the SC's contribution involves mechanisms that operate independently of the established signatures of attention in visual cortex. These findings raise new issues and suggest novel possibilities for understanding the brain mechanisms that enable spatial attention.},

  doi = {10.1145/3205455.3205615},
  abstract = {Generally intelligent agents exhibit successful behavior across prob-lems in several settings. Endemic in approaches to realize such intelligence in machines is catastrophic forgetting: sequential learn-ing corrupts knowledge obtained earlier in the sequence, or tasks antagonistically compete for system resources. Methods for obvi-ating catastrophic forgetting have sought to identify and preserve features of the system necessary to solve one problem when learn-ing to solve another, or to enforce modularity such that minimally overlapping sub-functions contain task specific knowledge. While successful, both approaches scale poorly because they require larger architectures as the number of training instances grows, causing different parts of the system to specialize for separate subsets of the data. Here we present a method for addressing catastrophic forget-ting called developmental compression. It exploits the mild impacts of developmental mutations to lessen adverse changes to previously-evolved capabilities and 'compresses' specialized neural networks into a generalized one. In the absence of domain knowledge, devel-opmental compression produces systems that avoid overt special-ization, alleviating the need to engineer a bespoke system for every task permutation and suggesting better scalability than existing ap-proaches. We validate this method on a robot control problem and hope to extend this approach to other machine learning domains in the future.},

First, the perceptual saliency of stimuli critically depends on the surrounding context. Second, a unique 'saliency map' that topographically encodes for stimulus conspicuity over the visual scene has proved to be an efficient and plausible bottom-up control strategy. Third, inhibition of return, the process by which the currently attended location is prevented from being attended again, is a crucial element of attentional deployment. Fourth, attention and eye movements tightly interplay, posing computational challenges with respect to the coordinate system used to control attention. And last, scene understanding and object recognition strongly constrain the selection of attended locations. Insights from these five key areas provide a framework for a computational and neurobiological understanding of visual attention.},

  abstract = {Cognitive behaviour requires complex context-dependent processing of information that emerges from the links between attentional perceptual processes, working memory and reward-based evaluation of the performed actions. We describe a computational neuroscience theoretical framework which shows how an attentional state held in a short term memory in the prefrontal cortex can by top-down processing influence ventral and dorsal stream cortical areas using biased competition to account for many aspects of visual attention. We also show how within the prefrontal cortex an attentional bias can influence the mapping of sensory inputs to motor outputs, and thus play an important role in decision making. We also show how the absence of expected rewards can switch an attentional bias signal, and thus rapidly and flexibly alter cognitive performance. This theoretical framework incorporates spiking and synaptic dynamics which enable single neuron responses, fMRI activations, psychophysical results, the effects of pharmacological agents, and the effects of damage to parts of the system to be explicitly simulated and predicted. This computational neuroscience framework provides an approach for integrating different levels of investigation of brain function, and for understanding the relations between them. The models also directly address how bottom-up and top-down processes interact in visual cognition, and show how some apparently serial processes reflect the operation of interacting parallel distributed systems. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This framework is consistent with the underlying assump- tions of the analysis method and its elements are correlated with human perception. The sound signal has to conform to certain conditions for its power spectrum to have a physi- cal and perceptual meaning. We contend that very few environmental sounds readily meet these criteria and argue that the quantities that are traditionally used to describe sounds need to be repurposed and, if necessary, redefined to represent sounds by non-Fourier means. We propose a perceptuo-analytic organization of sounds so that any environmental sound can be analyzed based on its signal characteristics and perception. Wepresent environmental sound acquisition in the context of collection and annotation of a database for the footstep sounds, a common environmental sound, and show that it can be represented by these unconventional means and further analyzed to produce descrip- tions which are obscured with the traditional analysis. We present a novel application of extracting gait characteristics from the footstep sounds which is enabled by the proposed framework.},

To provide a practical perspective, we present empirical results on both real and synthetic data sets that demonstrate that this effect can occur for as few as 10\textendash{}15 dimensions. These results should not be interpreted to mean that high-dimensional indexing is never meaningful; we illustrate this point by identifying some high-dimensional workloads for which this effect does not occur. However, our results do emphasize that the methodology used almost universally in the database literature to evaluate high-dimensional indexing techniques is flawed, and should be modified. In particular, most such techniques proposed in the literature are not evaluated versus simple linear scan, and are evaluated over workloads for which nearest neighbor is not meaningful. Often, even the reported experiments, when analyzed carefully, show that linear scan would outperform the techniques being proposed on the workloads studied in high (10\textendash{}15) dimensionality!},

The goal of this paper is to dispel the magic behind this black box. This tutorial focuses on building a solid intuition for how and why principal component analysis works; furthermore, it crystallizes this knowledge by deriving from first prin-cipals, the mathematics behind PCA . This tutorial does not shy away from explaining the ideas infor-mally, nor does it shy away from the mathematics. The hope is that by addressing both aspects, readers of all levels will be able to gain a better understand-ing of the power of PCA as well as the when, the how and the why of applying this technique.},

  doi = {10.7717/peerj.488},
  abstract = {Automatic species classification of birds from their sound is a computational tool of increasing importance in ecology, conservation monitoring and vocal communication studies. To make classification useful in practice, it is crucial to improve its accuracy while ensuring that it can run at big data scales. Many approaches use acoustic measures based on spectrogram-type data, such as the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features which represent a manually-designed summary of spectral information. However, recent work in machine learning has demonstrated that features learnt automatically from data can often outperform manually-designed feature transforms. Feature learning can be performed at large scale and "unsupervised", meaning it requires no manual data labelling, yet it can improve performance on "supervised" tasks such as classification. In this work we introduce a technique for feature learning from large volumes of bird sound recordings, inspired by techniques that have proven useful in other domains. We experimentally compare twelve different feature representations derived from the Mel spectrum (of which six use this technique), using four large and diverse databases of bird vocalisations, with a random forest classifier. We demonstrate that MFCCs are of limited power in this context, leading to worse performance than the raw Mel spectral data. Conversely, we demonstrate that unsupervised feature learning provides a substantial boost over MFCCs and Mel spectra without adding computational complexity after the model has been trained. The boost is particularly notable for single-label classification tasks at large scale. The spectro-temporal activations learned through our procedure resemble spectro-temporal receptive fields calculated from avian primary auditory forebrain.},

Many anomaly detection techniques have been specifically developed for certain application domains, while others are more generic. This survey tries to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on anomaly detection. We have grouped existing techniques into different categories based on the underlying approach adopted by each technique. For each category we have identified key assumptions, which are used by the techniques to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. When applying a given technique to a particular domain, these assumptions can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and then show how the different existing techniques in that category are variants of the basic technique. This template provides an easier and more succinct understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. Further, for each category, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques in that category. We also provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the techniques since it is an important issue in real application domains. We hope that this survey will provide a better understanding of the different directions in which research has been done on this topic, and how techniques developed in one area can be applied in domains for which they were not intended to begin with.},

Beginning in the early eighties, the personal computer (PC) market has been the dominant market influencing the semiconductor industry. Single-chip microprocessors (MPUs) enabled what became the huge PC market, which ultimately overshadowed the earlier minicomputer and mainframe computer markets. The popularity of PCs led to investments in increasingly more powerful MPUs and memory chips of ever-growing capacity. MPUs and DRAMs became the semiconductor industry technology drivers for the data processing needs of the PC. But now, DSP, as opposed to conventional data processing, has become the major technology driver for the semiconductor industry as evidenced by its market growth and the fervour of chip vendors to provide new products based on DSP technology. The increasing need to digitally process analog information signals, like audio and video, is causing a major shift in the semiconductor business. Since DSP is the mathematical manipulation of those digitized information signals, specialized math circuitry is required for efficient signal processing-circuitry that was previously confined to classical DSP chips},

  title = {Effective {{Identities}} for {{Trusted Interactions}} in {{Converged Telecommunication Systems}}},
  abstract = {Telecommunication systems have evolved significantly and the recent convergence of telephony allows users to communicate through landlines, mobile phones and Voice over IP (VoIP) phones. Unfortunately this convergence has resulted in easy manipulation of caller identity, resulting in both VoIP spam and Caller ID spoofing. In this dissertation, we introduce the notion of effective identity which is a combination of mechanisms to (1) establish identity of the caller that is harder to manipulate, and (2) provide additional information about the caller. We first use effective identities to address the VoIP spam problem by proposing CallRank, a novel mechanism built around call duration and social network linkages to differentiate between a legitimate user and a spammer. To ensure that this mechanism is privacy preserving, we create a token framework that allows a user to prove the existence of a social network path between him and the user he is trying to initiate contact with, without actually revealing the path. We then look at the broader issue of determining identity across the entire telecommunication landscape to address Caller ID spoofing. Towards this, we develop PinDr0p, a technique to determine the provenance of a call - the source and the path taken by a call. In the absence of any verifiable metadata, provenance offers a means of uniquely identifying a call source. Finally, we use anomalies in timbre to develop London Calling, a mechanism to identify geography of a caller. Together, the contributions made in this dissertation create effective identities that can help address the new threats in a converged telecommunication infrastructure.},

Our techniques detect and mea- sure single-ended audio features to identify all of the applied voice codecs, calculate packet loss and noise profiles, while remaining agnostic to characteristics of the speaker's voice (as this may le- gitimately change when interacting with a large organization). In the absence of verifiable call metadata, these features in combina- tion with machine learning allow us to determine the traversal of a call through as many as three different providers (e.g., cellular, then VoIP, then PSTN and all combinations and subsets thereof) with 91.6\% accuracy. Moreover, we show that once we identify and characterize the networks traversed, we can create detailed fin- gerprints for a call source. Using these fingerprints we show that we are able to distinguish between calls made using specific PSTN, cellular, Vonage, Skype and other hard and soft phones from loca- tions across the world with over 90\% accuracy. In so doing, we provide a first step in accurately determining the provenance of a call.},

To overcome this constraint, we developed a fully computer-controlled general purpose system for high-throughput training of rodents. By standardizing and automating the implementation of predefined training protocols within the animal's home-cage our system dramatically reduces the efforts involved in animal training while also removing human errors and biases from the process. We deployed this system to train rats in a variety of sensorimotor tasks, achieving learning rates comparable to existing, but more laborious, methods. By incrementally and systematically increasing the difficulty of the task over weeks of training, rats were able to master motor tasks that, in complexity and structure, resemble ones used in primate studies of motor sequence learning. By enabling fully automated training of rodents in a home-cage setting this low-cost and modular system increases the utility of rodents for studying the neural underpinnings of a variety of complex behaviors.},

  abstract = {Motor cortex is widely believed to underlie the acquisition and execution of motor skills, but its contributions to these processes are not fully understood. One reason is that studies on motor skills often conflate motor cortex's established role in dexterous control with roles in learning and producing task-specific motor sequences. To dissociate these aspects, we developed a motor task for rats that trains spatiotemporally precise movement patterns without requirements for dexterity. Remarkably, motor cortex lesions had no discernible effect on the acquired skills, which were expressed in their distinct pre-lesion forms on the very first day of post-lesion training. Motor cortex lesions prior to training, however, rendered rats unable to acquire the stereotyped motor sequences required for the task. These results suggest a remarkable capacity of subcortical motor circuits to execute learned skills and a previously unappreciated role for motor cortex in "tutoring" these circuits during learning. Motor cortex is widely credited with expanding the behavioral repertoire of mammals by enabling the acquisition and execution of new motor skills, but its specific contributions have been difficult to pin down. Using a novel motor skill learning paradigm, Kawai etal. show that motor cortex contributes to learning skills even when it is not required to execute them. This demonstrates a previously unappreciated role for motor cortex in "tutoring" subcortical circuits during skill learning.},

They are able to incorporate context information in a flexible way, and are robust to lo- calised distortions of the input data. These properties make them well suited to sequence labelling, where input sequences are transcribed with streams of labels. Long short-term memory is an especially promising recurrent archi- tecture, able to bridge long time delays between relevant input and output events, and thereby access long range context. The aim of this thesis is to advance the state-of-the-art in supervised sequence labelling with recurrent networks in general, and long short-term memory in particular. Its two main contributions are (1) a new type of output layer that allows recurrent networks to be trained directly for sequence labelling tasks where the align- ment between the inputs and the labels is unknown, and (2) an extension of long short-term memory to multidimensional data, such as images and video sequences. Experimental results are presented on speech recognition, online and offline handwriting recognition, keyword spotting, image segmen- tation and image classification, demonstrating the advantages of advanced recurrent networks over other sequential algorithms, such as hidden Markov Models. ii},

  abstract = {In birds, optic flow is analyzed by two retinal-recipient nuclei: the nucleus of the basal optic root (nBOR) of the accessory optic system (AOS), and the pretectal nucleus, lentiformis mesencephali (LM). Previous anatomical studies have shown that both of these nuclei have descending projections to structures involved in oculomotor, head movement, and postural control. In this report, using biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) and cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) for anterograde and retrograde labelling, respectively, we investigated projections from the nBOR and LM to the dorsal thalamus. After injections of BDA into the nBOR and LM, terminals were consistently found in the nucleus dorsolateralis anterior pars lateralis and pars medialis, and the nucleus dorsalis intermedius ventralis anterior of the thalamus. Some terminals were also found in the nucleus dorsolateralis anterior, nucleus dorsomedialis anterior pars magnocellularis, nucleus dorsolateralis posterior, nucleus superficialis parvocellularis, and the ventrointermediate area. Injections of CTB into the dorsal thalamus resulted in retrogradely labelled cells in the pretectal region, including LM. Numerous cells were also seen in the nBOR pars lateralis and pars dorsalis, but fewer were seen in the nBOR proper. We suggest that the AOS is providing input to a thalamotelencephalic system that may be involved in several functions including: (1) multi-sensory analysis of self-motion, (2) perception of self-motion, (3) perception of the three-dimensional layout of the environment, (4) distinguishing object-motion from self-motion, and (5) spatial cognition.},

Studies in humans and a small number of other species have provided insights into the neural and genetic basis for learned vocal communication and are helping to delineate the roles of brain circuits across the cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum in generating vocal behaviors. This Review provides an outline of the current knowledge about these circuits and the genes implicated in vocal communication, as well as a perspective on future research directions in this field.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0159188},
  abstract = {Researches on sequential vocalization often require analysis of vocalizations in long continuous sounds. In such studies as developmental ones or studies across generations in which days or months of vocalizations must be analyzed, methods for automatic recognition would be strongly desired. Although methods for automatic speech recognition for application purposes have been intensively studied, blindly applying them for biological purposes may not be an optimal solution. This is because, unlike human speech recognition, analysis of sequential vocalizations often requires accurate extraction of timing information. In the present study we propose automated systems suitable for recognizing birdsong, one of the most intensively investigated sequential vocalizations, focusing on the three properties of the birdsong. First, a song is a sequence of vocal elements, called notes, which can be grouped into categories. Second, temporal structure of birdsong is precisely controlled, meaning that temporal information is important in song analysis. Finally, notes are produced according to certain probabilistic rules, which may facilitate the accurate song recognition. We divided the procedure of song recognition into three sub-steps: local classification, boundary detection, and global sequencing, each of which corresponds to each of the three properties of birdsong. We compared the performances of several different ways to arrange these three steps. As results, we demonstrated a hybrid model of a deep convolutional neural network and a hidden Markov model was effective. We propose suitable arrangements of methods according to whether accurate boundary detection is needed. Also we designed the new measure to jointly evaluate the accuracy of note classification and boundary detection. Our methods should be applicable, with small modification and tuning, to the songs in other species that hold the three properties of the sequential vocalization.},

  abstract = {Significant trial-by-trial variation persists even in the most practiced skills. One prevalent view is that such variation is simply 'noise' that the nervous system is unable to control or that remains below threshold for behavioural relevance. An alternative hypothesis is that such variation enables trial-and-error learning, in which the motor system generates variation and differentially retains behaviours that give rise to better outcomes. Here we test the latter possibility for adult bengalese finch song. Adult birdsong is a complex, learned motor skill that is produced in a highly stereotyped fashion from one rendition to the next. Nevertheless, there is subtle trial-by-trial variation even in stable, 'crystallized' adult song. We used a computerized system to monitor small natural variations in the pitch of targeted song elements and deliver real-time auditory disruption to a subset of those variations. Birds rapidly shifted the pitch of their vocalizations in an adaptive fashion to avoid disruption. These vocal changes were precisely restricted to the targeted features of song. Hence, birds were able to learn effectively by associating small variations in their vocal behaviour with differential outcomes. Such a process could help to maintain stable, learned song despite changes to the vocal control system arising from ageing or injury. More generally, our results suggest that residual variability in well learned skills is not entirely noise but rather reflects meaningful motor exploration that can support continuous learning and optimization of performance.},

Deep Voice lays the groundwork for truly end-to-end neural speech synthesis. The system comprises five major building blocks: a segmentation model for locating phoneme boundaries, a grapheme-to-phoneme conversion model, a phoneme duration prediction model, a fundamental frequency prediction model, and an audio synthesis model. For the segmentation model, we propose a novel way of performing phoneme boundary detection with deep neural networks using connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss. For the audio synthesis model, we implement a variant of WaveNet that requires fewer parameters and trains faster than the original. By using a neural network for each component, our system is simpler and more flexible than traditional text-to-speech systems, where each component requires laborious feature engineering and extensive domain expertise. Finally, we show that inference with our system can be performed faster than real time and describe optimized WaveNet inference kernels on both CPU and GPU that achieve up to 400x speedups over existing implementations.},

Representations of the input segments (i.e., contiguous subsequences of the input) are computed by encoding their constituent tokens using bidirectional recurrent neural nets, and these "segment embeddings" are used to define compatibility scores with output labels. These local compatibility scores are integrated using a global semi-Markov conditional random field. Both fully supervised training -- in which segment boundaries and labels are observed -- as well as partially supervised training -- in which segment boundaries are latent -- are straightforward. Experiments on handwriting recognition and joint Chinese word segmentation/POS tagging show that, compared to models that do not explicitly represent segments such as BIO tagging schemes and connectionist temporal classification (CTC), SRNNs obtain substantially higher accuracies.},

Key to our approach is our application of HPC techniques, resulting in a 7x speedup over our previous system. Because of this efficiency, experiments that previously took weeks now run in days. This enables us to iterate more quickly to identify superior architectures and algorithms. As a result, in several cases, our system is competitive with the transcription of human workers when benchmarked on standard datasets. Finally, using a technique called Batch Dispatch with GPUs in the data center, we show that our system can be inexpensively deployed in an online setting, delivering low latency when serving users at scale.},

Also, no neurons have been found to respond to perturbation of auditory feedback in the brain area that is thought to be involved in the feedback control of song. The phenomenon of gating in which neurons respond to playback of the bird's own song only during sleep or under anesthesia is the sole known evidence for control of auditory input to the song system. It is, however, not known whether the gating is involved in switching between the premotor and auditory function of neurons in the song control system.},

This circuit conveys warning signals about impending eye movements that are used for planning subsequent movements and analyzing the visual world. Identifying this circuit has provided a model for studying CD in other primate sensory systems and may lead to a better understanding of motor and mental disorders.},

The striatal medium spiny neurones are projection neurones and they form synaptic contacts with output neurones in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra reticulata. In this way, dopaminergic afferents can directly modulate the flow of information from cortical areas through the striatum to the 'premotor' areas of the brainstem and to the thalamus. It is proposed that certain parts of the striatum can themselves control the activity of midbrain dopamine neurones and so one part of the striatum can 'gate' the flow of information through another part. \textcopyright{} 1990.},

  abstract = {Movement suppression in Parkinson's disease (PD) is thought to arise from increased efficacy of the indirect pathway basal ganglia circuit, relative to the direct pathway. However, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain elusive. To examine whether changes in the strength of synaptic inputs to these circuits contribute to this imbalance, we obtained paired whole-cell recordings from striatal direct- and indirect-pathway medium spiny neurons (dMSNs and iMSNs) and optically stimulated inputs from sensorimotor cortex or intralaminar thalamus in brain slices from control and dopamine-depleted mice. We found that dopamine depletion selectively decreased synaptic strength at thalamic inputs to dMSNs, suggesting that thalamus drives asymmetric activation of basal ganglia circuitry underlying parkinsonian motor impairments. Consistent with this hypothesis, in vivo chemogenetic and optogenetic inhibition of thalamostriatal terminals reversed motor deficits in dopamine-depleted mice. These results implicate thalamostriatal projections in the pathophysiology of PD and support interventions targeting thalamus as a potential therapeutic strategy. Parker et al. find that thalamostriatal synapses are a site of maladaptive changes in PD mice. After dopamine depletion, the relative strength of thalamic drive to the two basal ganglia output pathways was reversed, biasing drive away from the "Go" pathway. Chemogenetic or optogenetic inhibition of thalamic inputs to striatum restored motor function.},

  abstract = {The cerebral cortex and the intralaminar thalamic nuclei are the major sources of excitatory glutamatergic afferents to the striatum, whereas the midbrain catecholaminergic neurones provide a dense intrastriatal plexus of dopamine-containing terminals. Evidence from various sources suggests that there is a functional interaction between the glutamate- and dopamine-containing terminals in the striatum. The aim of the present study was to determine the synaptic relationships between cortical or thalamic inputs and the dopaminergic afferents in the sensorimotor territory of the monkey striatum. To address this issue, anterograde tracing in combination with immunocytochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) was carried out by light and electron microscopy. Squirrel monkeys received injections of biocytin in the primary motor and somatosensory cortical areas or injections of either Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) or biocytin in the centromedian nucleus (CM) of the thalamus. Sections that included the striatum were processed to visualize the anterograde tracers alone or in combination with TH immunoreactivity. The anterogradely labelled fibres from the cerebral cortex and CM display a band-like pattern and are exclusively confined to the postcommissural region of the putamen, whereas TH-immunoreactive axon terminals are homogeneously distributed throughout the entire extent of the striatum. Electron microscopic analysis revealed that the anterogradely labelled terminals from the cerebral cortex form asymmetric synapses almost exclusively with the heads of dendritic spines. The thalamic terminals also form asymmetric synapses, but in contrast to cortical fibres, predominantly with dendrites (67.4\%) and less frequently with spines (32.6\%). The TH-immunoreactive boutons are heterogeneous in morphology. The most common type (84\% of the total population) forms symmetric synapses; of these the majority is in contact with dendritic shafts (72.1\%), less with spines (22.5\%) and few with perikarya (5.4\%). In sections processed to reveal anterogradely labelled cortical fibres and TH-immunoreactive structures, individual spines of striatal neurones were found to receive convergent synaptic inputs from both cortical and TH-immunoreactive boutons. In contrast, anterogradely labelled thalamic terminals and TH-immunoreactive boutons were never seen to form convergent synaptic contacts on the same postsynaptic structure. These findings suggest that the dopaminergic afferents are located to subserve a more specific modulation of afferent cortical input than afferent thalamic input in the sensorimotor territory of the striatum in primates},

  abstract = {The striatum-the primary input nucleus of the basal ganglia-plays a major role in motor control and learning. Four main classes of striatal neuron are thought to be essential for normal striatal function: medium spiny neurons, fast-spiking interneurons, cholinergic tonically active neurons, and low-threshold spiking interneurons. However, the nature of the interaction of these neurons during behavior is poorly understood. The songbird area X is a specialized striato-pallidal basal ganglia nucleus that contains two pallidal cell types as well as the same four cell types found in the mammalian striatum. We recorded 185 single units in Area X of singing juvenile birds and, based on singing-related firing patterns and spike waveforms, find six distinct cell classes--two classes of putative pallidal neuron that exhibited a high spontaneous firing rate ({$>$} 60 Hz), and four cell classes that exhibited low spontaneous firing rates characteristic of striatal neurons. In this study, we examine in detail the four putative striatal cell classes. Type-1 neurons were the most frequently encountered and exhibited sparse temporally precise singing-related activity. Type-2 neurons were distinguished by their narrow spike waveforms and exhibited brief, high-frequency bursts during singing. Type-3 neurons were tonically active and did not burst, whereas type-4 neurons were inactive outside of singing and during singing generated long high-frequency bursts that could reach firing rates over 1 kHz. Based on comparison to the mammalian literature, we suggest that these four putative striatal cell classes correspond, respectively, to the medium spiny neurons, fast-spiking interneurons, tonically active neurons, and low-threshold spiking interneurons that are known to reside in area X.},

  abstract = {The anterior forebrain pathway (AFP) of the oscine song system is essential for song learning but not song production. Most cells recorded in this serially connected pathway show increased firing in response to song playback, suggesting largely excitatory connections among AFP nuclei. However, the neurons forming a key projection in this pathway, from area X to the medial nucleus of the dorsolateral thalamus (DLM), express glutamic acid decarboxylase in their somata and terminals, suggesting an inhibitory connection. To investigate the firing properties of DLM neurons and the functional influence of area X afferents in DLM, we made whole-cell recordings from DLM neurons in brain slices from adult male zebra finches. Most cells had intrinsic properties closely resembling those of mammalian thalamocortical cells, including a low-threshold Ca(2+) spike and time-dependent, hyperpolarization-activated inward rectification. Activation of afferents from area X evoked a strong, all-or-none IPSP whose amplitude and latency were unchanged by application of glutamate antagonists, consistent with a monosynaptic contact. The IPSP had a reversal potential near -70 mV and was blocked by the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline methiodide. Post-inhibitory rebound firing occurred in DLM neurons with a delay near 50 msec. Strong inhibition can combine with the intrinsic properties of DLM neurons to allow signaling on disinhibition. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that the AFP corresponds to the mammalian corticobasal ganglia-thalamocortical loop. The similar functional properties of avian and mammalian thalamic neurons suggest conserved forebrain mechanisms of sensorimotor information processing across vertebrate taxa.},

  abstract = {The medial magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum (mMAN) is a small cortical nucleus which was previously identified as a component of the neural circuitry controlling vocal behavior in songbirds based on its efferent connection to the High Vocal Center (HVC), a major song control nucleus (Nottebohm et al. [1982] J. Comp. Neurol. 207:344-357; Bottjer et al. [1989] J. Comp. Neurol. 279:312-326). We have conducted tract tracing experiments (using wheat-germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP), the carbocyanine dye DiI, and biocytin) to determine the complete pattern of afferent and efferent connections of mMAN in adult male zebra finches. We confirmed the existence of an efferent projection from mMAN to HVC and discovered a novel projection to the region medial to caudal HVC called paraHVC (pHVC). Injections of retrograde tracers into mMAN showed that afferent input to mMAN originates from the dorsomedial nucleus of the posterior thalamus (DMP). Injections of DiI into DMP produced anterograde label over mMAN, thus confirming the DMP-to-mMAN projection. Interestingly, this anterograde label extended beyond the region of mMAN defined by HVC-projecting neurons into the immediately surrounding cortex. This extended terminal field of DMP efferents indicates that mMAN encompasses a core population of projection neurons surrounded by a shell of non-HVC-projecting neurons, both of which receive input from the dorsal thalamus. Analysis of retrograde DiI label resulting from DMP injections revealed two major sources of afferent input to DMP originating in regions of the archistriatum and hypothalamus. Inputs to DMP were distributed throughout the dorsal archistriatum and included the area that receives a projection from the parvicellular shell region of the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum, a song control nucleus, as well as the dorsal portion of the robust nucleus of the archistriatum, the motor-cortical output of the song control system. The projections from song control regions of the archistriatum to DMP may feed information back into telencephalic song control circuitry via the DMP--{$>$}mMAN--{$>$}HVC/pHVC pathway. The other source of afferent input to DMP is located in the external cellular stratum of the lateral hypothalamus (SCE). This newly delineated SCE--{$>$}DMP--{$>$}mMAN--{$>$}HVC/pHVC pathway is the first report of a hypothalamic brain region neuroanatomically integrated with song control circuitry. Because hypothalamic brain regions are important for homeostasis and regulating behavior, the trans-synaptic circuitry of mMAN may help to integrate information about the bird's internal state, such as sexual maturation, with song learning and production.},

  abstract = {The cerebellum influences behavior and cognition exclusively via Purkinje cell synapses onto neurons in the deep cerebellar and vestibular nuclei. In contrast with the rich information available about the organization of the cerebellar cortex and its synaptic inputs, relatively little is known about microcircuitry postsynaptic to Purkinje cells. Here we examined the cell types and microcircuits through which Purkinje cells influence an oculomotor behavior controlled by the cerebellum, the horizontal vestibulo-ocular reflex, which involves only two eye muscles. Using a combination of anatomical tracing and electrophysiological recordings in transgenic mouse lines, we identified several classes of neurons in the medial vestibular nucleus that receive Purkinje cell synapses from the cerebellar flocculus. Glycinergic and glutamatergic flocculus target neurons (FTNs) with somata densely surrounded by Purkinje cell terminals projected axons to the ipsilateral abducens and oculomotor nuclei, respectively. Of three additional types of FTNs that were sparsely innervated by Purkinje cells, glutamatergic and glycinergic neurons projected to the contralateral and ipsilateral abducens, respectively, and GABAergic neurons projected to contralateral vestibular nuclei. Densely innervated FTNs had high spontaneous firing rates and pronounced postinhibitory rebound firing, and were physiologically homogeneous, whereas the intrinsic excitability of sparsely innervated FTNs varied widely. Heterogeneity in the molecular expression, physiological properties, and postsynaptic targets of FTNs implies that Purkinje cell activity influences the neural control of eye movements in several distinct ways. These results indicate that the cerebellum regulates a simple reflex behavior via at least five different cell types that are postsynaptic to Purkinje cells.},

  abstract = {Motor learning can be demonstrated in the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) by changing its gain (eye velocity/head velocity) with goggles and optokinetic (OK) drums. It is known that the flocculus is essential for this plasticity but there is controversy about whether the modifiable synapses mainly responsible are in the flocculus. To investigate this further we utilized the known reciprocal relationship between complex spikes and simple spikes in Purkinje cell discharges. By stimulating climbing fibers from the olive to the flocculus at 7 Hz, the simple spike rate of almost all recorded floccular cells could be driven to zero. This was termed floccular shutdown and it felt to effect a functional, reversible flocculectomy. Sixty single units in the flocculi of four cats were recorded. Stimulation of the climbing fibers at 7 Hz caused the discharge rate to decrease to zero in 95\% of these cells. The gain of the horizontal VOR in three cats was driven repeatedly to twice or half its normal value by rotation within a moving OK drum and also by wearing magnifying or fixed-field goggles; this process required 3 days. If, on the 4th day, the cat was exposed to an OK drum rotating in the opposite direction, the gain was driven back to normal in 30 min. If, however, the climbing fibers were stimulated at 7 Hz during these 30 min, the gain did not return--learning was blocked. This verified that loss of floccular activity by this method abolishes VOR gain plasticity. Moreover, when 7 Hz stimulation first began, after 3 days of adaptation, the adapted gain remained at its adapted value, either half or twice normal, even in the face of floccular shutdown. This result appears incompatible with the hypothesis that the modifiable synapses are in the flocculus.},

Here, we review the properties of the many cell types in the vestibular nuclei, as well as some fundamental computations implemented within this brainstem-cerebellar circuitry. These include the sensorimotor transformations for reflex generation, the neural computations for inertial motion estimation, the distinction between active and passive head movements, as well as the integration of vestibular and proprioceptive information for body motion estimation. A common theme in the solution to such computational problems is the concept of internal models and their neural implementation. Recent studies have shed new insights into important organizational principles that closely resemble those proposed for other sensorimotor systems, where their neural basis has often been more difficult to identify. As such, the vestibular system provides an excellent model to explore common neural processing strategies relevant both for reflexive and for goal-directed, voluntary movement as well as perception.},

  abstract = {Immediate-early genes are part of a cellular response mechanism that reacts to biochemical, electrical, pharmacological, and physiological stimuli as well as changes in behavioral state. In the brain, immediate-early genes-such as egr-1 have been used as markers for neuronal activity. These markers could be invaluable in studies that utilize the chick-quail chimaera system to investigate neural components of behavior. Therefore, we decided to clone avian homologs of immediate-early genes to allow an expression analysis in behavioral paradigms and to determine the degree of conservation among diverse species. We report in this study the cloning of the ZENK gene, an egr-1 homolog, from chicken, quail, zebrafinch, and canary. We show that the coding region of this gene is highly conserved and follows established phylogenetic relationships. In situ hybridization demonstrates that the expression pattern is also conserved among species. We further demonstrate that there are regions in the 3' untranslated area of the ZENK gene that are as highly conserved as the protein-coding region and that may play a role in postranscriptional regulatory mechanisms of ZENK gene expression.},

  abstract = {The way in which the cerebellum influences the output of the motor cortex is not known. The aim of this study was to establish whether information about force, velocity or duration of movement is encoded in cerebellar thalamic discharge and could therefore be involved in the modulation of motor cortical activity. Extracellular single cell recordings were made from the cerebellar thalamus (66 neurones) and VPLc (49 neurones) of four conscious macaques performing simple wrist movements with various load and gain conditions imposed. A significant correlation (Spearman's; P{$<$}0.05) was found between movement duration and the duration of neuronal discharge of most cerebellar thalamic neurones (65\%), the velocity of movement and rate of neuronal discharge of some cerebellar thalamic neurones (23\%), but not between force of movement and rate of neuronal discharge of any cerebellar thalamic neurones. Similar relationships were found between the activity of VPLc neurones and these movement parameters. The strength of the correlations increased when many cells were grouped and analysed as an ensemble, suggesting that populations of cerebellar thalamic (and VPLc) neurones can encode a signal with higher fidelity than single neurones alone. The ensemble data confirmed that the most robust association was between the duration of neuronal discharge and movement duration. We propose that the cerebellum does not provide the motor cortex with specific information about movement force or velocity, but rather that its major role is in activating many motor cortical regions for a specific duration, thus influencing the timing of complex movements involving many muscles and joints.},

  abstract = {The cerebellum can affect speech and language in a number of ways. The most obvious is dysarthria when motor movements are deprived of the regulatory control, which is one of the main functions of the cerebellum. Less well-known is cerebellar mutism, which most often occurs after the removal of a cerebellar tumour. It is unlikely that this is simply the result of dysarthria. The most controversial aspect of cerebellar function, and the main stress of this paper, is the contribution it may make to language production. A number of studies have suggested that the cerebellum can, indeed, be involved in both cognition and language. A number of these are reviewed, in particular, the results of diffuse and focal lesions of the cerebellum, and how these can affect the function of the cerebrum; and conversely how cerebral lesions can cause changes in the cerebellum. Positron emission tomography (PET) has been essential in the assessment of these patients. During human evolution parts of the cerebellum and their connections have enlarged enormously, and it would be surprising if these parts of the brain had not taken on new roles. To regard the cerebellum as only serving motor function is too narrow a concept.},

  abstract = {Classical conditioning of the eye-blink reflex in the rabbit is a form of motor learning that is uniquely dependent on the cerebellum. The cerebellar learning hypothesis proposes that plasticity subserving eye-blink conditioning occurs in the cerebellum. The major evidence for this hypothesis originated from studies based on a telecommunications network metaphor of eye-blink circuits. These experiments inactivated parts of cerebellum-related networks during the acquisition and expression of classically conditioned eye blinks in order to determine sites at which the plasticity occurred. However, recent evidence revealed that these manipulations could be explained by a network performance hypothesis which attributes learning deficits to a non-specific tonic dysfunction of eye-blink networks. Since eye-blink conditioning is mediated by a spontaneously active, recurrent neuronal network with strong tonic interactions, differentiating between the cerebellar learning hypothesis and the network performance hypothesis represents a major experimental challenge. A possible solution to this problem is offered by several promising new approaches that minimize the effects of experimental interventions on spontaneous neuronal activity. Results from these studies indicate that plastic changes underlying eye-blink conditioning are distributed across several cerebellar and extra-cerebellar regions. Specific input interactions that induce these plastic changes as well as their cellular mechanisms remain unresolved.},

  abstract = {1. Monkey interpositus neurones show large discharge modulations during reaching to grasp, however, the same neurones show little or no modulation during operation of devices that exercise individual forelimb joints. We tested the hypothesis that grasping during the reach-to-grasp is necessary for eliciting high discharge modulation. 2. Three monkeys (Macaca mulatta) moved an articulated lever between low and high target zones. While in the lower zone the monkey's hand was at its waist, in the upper zone its hand was in a position that required forelimb extension at right-angles to the body axis. Small drawers adjacent to the target zones contained raisins, and the drawers could be remotely opened. Thus, we could elicit two types of reaches having similar trajectories: one reach involved limb transport while holding the lever handle, and the other involved limb transport while forming the hand to grasp a raisin. 3. Eighty-one neurones from two monkeys, mostly from interpositus with some from adjacent regions of dentate, were tested during device use and reaching to grasp: 93\% of the neurones discharged at high rates during at least one of the tasks. Of these, about half increased discharge rate solely during reaching to grasp; the other half showed some increase during device use but only discharged strongly during reaching to grasp. Overall, discharge modulations during the reach-to-grasp averaged twice as high as during the corresponding device movement (112 versus 56 impulses s-1). 4. Individual neurones consistently discharged with characteristic patterns during the reach-to-grasp with rates often exceeding 300 impulses s-1. Discharge during the reach-to-grasp was independent of reach trajectory: discharge patterns and amplitudes were similar when reaching from either the lower or upper target zone to the upper raisin drawer as when reaching from the upper target zone to the upper raisin drawer. Reach direction also made little difference: reaches from the upper target zone to the lower drawer typically elicited similar discharge modulation as those from the lower target zone to the upper drawer. 5. High discharge rates associated with grasping were independent of the item being grasped: typically, grasping the device handle elicited as high discharge rates as grasping a raisin. 6. The hypothesis was confirmed that grasping is critical for eliciting high discharge modulation in interpositus during reaching to grasp. Discharge pattern and modulation do not vary with reach direction or amplitude of the reach and, therefore, it is unlikely that intermediate cerebellum controls these features of the reach-to-grasp.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract = {Recordings were made from 95 units of the dentate nucleus of naive cats to determine if patterns of response to 70 dB clicks could be distinguished from those to another acoustic stimulus (a hiss) of approximately equal sound pressure level. Further studies of an additional 309 units were conducted to determine if unit excitability and the response to clicks changed after Pavlovian conditioning in which blink responses were elicited by the clicks as conditioned stimuli. Over 50\% of units tested before conditioning responded to click or hiss with increased activity, and 8\% responded in the first 4-8 ms after the onset of the rapidly rising click. Cross-correlation of the respective 160 ms poststimulus histogram averages of mean activity showed dissimilar patterns of response to clicks and hisses (Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient + 0.02). Thus the averaged population responses distinguished these stimuli. In addition, individual cells were found in each behavioral state that responded selectively to either click or hiss. After conditioning with click as the conditioned stimulus, the number of units responding in the first 4-8 ms to click increased to 23\%. The mean magnitude of activity 4-8 ms after presenting the click increased after conditioning but not after sensitization produced by backward pairing of the stimuli used for conditioning. After backward pairing only 6\% of the units responded in the first 4-8 ms to click. The changes in activity after conditioning were accompanied by increases in neural excitability to intracellularly applied depolarizing current. In contrast with the changes in activity, the increases in neural excitability were also found after backward pairing. We conclude that short as well as long latency acoustic transmissions to click change in the dentate nucleus after conditioning, that changes in response to click are expressed in 4-8 ms responsive cells, and that many of these cells have different patterns of spike activity in response to click and hiss. The findings support the hypothesis that the dentate nucleus can play a significant role in short as well as long latency, adaptive acoustic transmission that can enhance the response to an acoustic signal used as a Pavlovian conditioned stimulus.},

The device was equipped with load cells to measure both the grip and lifting or load forces. On selected blocks of 20-30 trials, a downward force-pulse perturbation was applied to the object after 1.5 s of stationary holding. The animals were required to resist the perturbation to obtain a fruit juice reward. The perturbations invariably elicited a reflex-like, time-locked increase in grip force at latencies between 50 and 100 ms. In this study, we searched for single cells in the interpositus and dentate nuclei with activity related to grasping and lifting, and we tested 127/150 task-related cells for their responses to the perturbation. Of the 127 cells, reflex-like increases or decreases in discharge frequency occurred in 75 cells (59\%) at a mean latency of 36 ms. Preparatory increases in grip force preceding the perturbation appeared gradually and increased in strength with repetition in 39/127 (31\%) cells. These preparatory increases did not immediately disappear when the perturbations were withdrawn but decreased progressively over repeated trials. Although a few cells showed anticipatory activity without a reflex-like response (15/127 or 12\%), the majority of these cells (24/39) displayed both anticipatory and reflex-like responses. From an examination of the histological sections, cells with both anticipatory and reflex-like responses appeared to be confined to the dorsal anterior interpositus, adjacent to, but not within, the dentate nucleus. These results confirm and extend the suggestion by Dugas and Smith that the cerebellum plays a major role in organizing anticipatory responses to predictable perturbations in a manner that medial and lateral premotor areas of the cerebral cortex do not.},

  abstract = {Neurons in the cerebellar interpositus nucleus greatly increase their discharge rates when a monkey reaches out to grasp an object. However, when the monkey is required to track a target on a screen by moving a manipulandum, the increase in discharge rate is relatively small or nonexistent. Moving the hand directly to a target is a visuomotor task that may be fundamentally different from a remote tracking task. We hypothesize that the interpositus nucleus is specialized for direct visual guidance of the limb or, alternatively, interpositus is specialized for controlling hand movements required to grasp an object. A monkey was trained to hold a sensor and move it directly over a visual target to obtain water reward. Small drawers were mounted next to two of the targets; on some trials a drawer would open so that the monkey would reach out and retrieve a raisin that had been placed in it. Interpositus neurons discharged strongly during reach to grasp the raisin but not when the monkey was positioning the sensor over the target. For individual cells, discharge pattern and amplitude were largely independent of the size and direction of the reach to grasp, suggesting that interpositus does not control direction or amplitude of the reach. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that neurons in forelimb regions of interpositus participate in the control of hand movements used in grasping, but they are not consistent with the hypothesis that interpositus neurons participate in direct visual guidance of the limb.},

Audition-induced expression of this gene, in brain, has also recently been reported for the domestic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) and the Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica). Whilst the anatomical distribution of zenk expression was described for the quail, corresponding data for the chicken were not reported. We have, therefore, used in situ hybridisation to localise the mRNA that encodes the product of the zenk gene (which we call ZENK) within the brain of the 1-day-old chick. We demonstrate that this transcript is present in a number of forebrain structures including the medio-rostral neostriatum/hyperstriatum ventrale (MNH), a region that has been strongly implicated in auditory imprinting (which is a form of recognition memory), and Field L, the avian analog of the mammalian auditory cortex. Because of this pattern of gene expression, we have compared the level of the ZENK mRNA in chicks that have been subjected to a 30-min acoustic imprinting paradigm and in untrained controls. Our results reveal a significant increase (P{$<$} or =0.05) in the level of the ZENK mRNA in MNH and Field L, and in the two forebrain hemispheres; no increase was seen in the ectostriatum, which is a visual projection area. The data obtained implicate the immediate-early gene, zenk, in auditory imprinting, which is an established model of juvenile learning. In addition, our results indicate that the ZENK mRNA may be used as a molecular marker for MNH, a region that is difficult to anatomically and histochemically delineate.},

Inverse internal models can provide the neural command necessary to achieve some desired trajectory.

Forward internal models predict the consequences of actions and can be used to overcome time delays associated with feedback control. Secondly, we review the evidence that the cerebellum generates predictions using such a forward model. Finally, we review a computational model that includes multiple paired forward and inverse models and show how such an arrangement can be advantageous for motor learning and control.},

In each paradigm, change occurs through trial-and-error performance. In some of the tasks, damage of cerebellar cortex impairs adaptation and not performance. The deficits in performance cannot explain the deficits in adaptation. In some of the tasks, the discharge of Purkinje cells and, by inference, the discharge of inferior olive cells and mossy fibers have occurred in a manner consistent with the Marr-Albus theory of motor learning. We extend the theory to show how parallel fibers could implement both the coordination of complex movements and the learning of new movements. The size of the response combinations would be proportionate to the length of parallel fibers. The mechanism proposed here would permit optimized complex movement behaviors to respond to specific behavioral contexts rapidly, stereotypically, and automatically. The mechanism would permit storage of many context-response couplings and many complex responses. The mechanism would permit privacy, individuality, and a large number of behavioral responses.},

Patients with infarcts in the distribution of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery usually had impaired or absent adaptation but little or no ataxia. By contrast, patients with damage in the distribution of the superior cerebellar artery or in cerebellar thalamus usually had ataxia but preserved adaptation. These results implicate climbing fibres from the contralateral inferior olive via the ipsilateral inferior cerebellar peduncle, mossy fibres from the contralateral pontocerebellar nuclei via the ipsilateral middle cerebellar peduncle, and posterior inferior cerebellar artery territory cortex as being critical for this adaptation. The dentatothalamic projection and the superior cerebellar artery territory cortex are not necessary for this adaptation.},

We assume that climbing fiber responses represent motor-command errors generated by some of the premotor networks such as the feedback controllers at the spinal-, brain stem- and cerebral levels. Thus, in our model, climbing fiber responses are considered to convey motor errors in the motor-command coordinates rather than in the sensory coordinates. Based on the long-term depression in Purkinje cells each corticonuclear microcomplex in different regions of the cerebellum learns to execute predictive and coordinative control of different types of movements. Ultimately, it acquires an inverse model of a specific controlled object and complements crude control by the premotor networks. This general model is developed in detail as a specific neural circuit model for the lateral hemisphere. A new experiment is suggested to elucidate the coordinate frame in which climbing fiber responses are represented.},

  doi = {10.1152/jn.00943.2004},
  abstract = {Two different compensatory mechanisms are engaged when the nervous system senses errors during a reaching movement. First, on-line feedback control mechanisms produce in-flight corrections to reduce errors in the on-going movement. Second, these errors modify the internal model with which the motor plan is transformed into motor commands for the subsequent movements. What are the neural mechanisms of these compensatory systems? In a previous study, we reported that while on-line error correction was disturbed in patients with Huntington's disease (HD), it was largely intact in patients with cerebellar degeneration. Here we altered dynamics of reaching and studied the effect of error in one trial on the motor commands that initiated the subsequent trial. We observed that in patients with cerebellar degeneration, motor commands changed from trial-to-trial by an amount that was comparable to control subjects. However, these changes were random and were uninformed by the error in the preceding trial. In contrast, the change in motor commands of HD patients was strongly related to the error in the preceding trial. This error-dependent change had a sensitivity that was comparable to healthy controls. As a result, HD patients exhibited no significant deficits in adapting to novel arm dynamics, whereas cerebellar subjects were profoundly impaired. These results demonstrate a double dissociation between on-line and trial-to-trial error correction suggesting that these compensatory mechanisms have distinct neural bases that can be differentially affected by disease.},

  abstract = {In songbirds, the basal ganglia outflow nucleus LMAN is a cortical analog that is required for several forms of song plasticity and learning. Moreover, in adults, inactivating LMAN can reverse the initial expression of learning driven via aversive reinforcement. In the present study, we investigated how LMAN contributes to both reinforcement-driven learning and a self-driven recovery process in adult Bengalese finches. We first drove changes in the fundamental frequency of targeted song syllables and compared the effects of inactivating LMAN with the effects of interfering with N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent transmission from LMAN to one of its principal targets, the song premotor nucleus RA. Inactivating LMAN and blocking NMDA receptors in RA caused indistinguishable reversions in the expression of learning, indicating that LMAN contributes to learning through NMDA receptor-mediated glutamatergic transmission to RA. We next assessed how LMAN's role evolves over time by maintaining learned changes to song while periodically inactivating LMAN. The expression of learning consolidated to become LMAN independent over multiple days, indicating that this form of consolidation is not completed over one night, as previously suggested, and instead may occur gradually during singing. Subsequent cessation of reinforcement was followed by a gradual self-driven recovery of original song structure, indicating that consolidation does not correspond with the lasting retention of changes to song. Finally, for self-driven recovery, as for reinforcement-driven learning, LMAN was required for the expression of initial, but not later, changes to song. Our results indicate that NMDA receptor-dependent transmission from LMAN to RA plays an essential role in the initial expression of two distinct forms of vocal learning and that this role gradually wanes over a multiday process of consolidation. The results support an emerging view that cortical-basal ganglia circuits can direct the initial expression of learning via top-down influences on primary motor circuitry.},

A critical role of feedforward processing by the cerebellum has been established and linked to speech motor control and to aspects of ataxic dysarthria. Moreover, this research has helped to define models of the cerebellar contributions to speech processing and production, and to posit possible regions of speech localization within the cerebellum. Bilateral, superior areas of the cerebellum appear to mediate speech motor control while a putative role of the right cerebellar hemispheres in the planning and processing of speech has been suggested.},

  abstract = {A classical tenet of clinical neurology proposes that cerebellar disorders may give rise to speech motor disorders (ataxic dysarthria), but spare perceptual and cognitive aspects of verbal communication. During the past two decades, however, a variety of higher-order deficits of speech production, e.g., more or less exclusive agrammatism, amnesic or transcortical motor aphasia, have been noted in patients with vascular cerebellar lesions, and transient mutism following resection of posterior fossa tumors in children may develop into similar constellations. Perfusion studies provided evidence for cerebello-cerebral diaschisis as a possible pathomechanism in these instances. Tight functional connectivity between the language-dominant frontal lobe and the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere represents a prerequisite of such long-distance effects. Recent functional imaging data point at a contribution of the right cerebellar hemisphere, concomitant with language-dominant dorsolateral and medial frontal areas, to the temporal organization of a prearticulatory verbal code ('inner speech'), in terms of the sequencing of syllable strings at a speaker's habitual speech rate. Besides motor control, this network also appears to be engaged in executive functions, e.g., subvocal rehearsal mechanisms of verbal working memory, and seems to be recruited during distinct speech perception tasks. Taken together, thus, a prearticulatory verbal code bound to reciprocal right cerebellar/left frontal interactions might represent a common platform for a variety of cerebellar engagements in cognitive functions. The distinct computational operation provided by cerebellar structures within this framework appears to be the concatenation of syllable strings into coarticulated sequences.},

The various subject groups showed a similar range of overall motor disability. Patients with CA and PB exhibited slowed movement execution in terms of a reduced ratio of peak velocity to maximum amplitude ("stiffness"). In contrast to upper limb motor control, the lip excursions showed an uncompromised shape of velocity profiles. Two different patterns emerged in HD. A single patient suffering from the akinetic-rigid Westphal variant of this disease had articulatory hypometria, whereas the remaining subjects showed significant bradykinesia under increased temporal demands, concomitant with normal movement amplitudes. The PD patients had unimpaired velocity-displacement relationships. Presumably, biomechanical constraints such as the rather small excursions of articulatory lower lip gestures or the scarce spindle supply of facial muscles account for the observed discrepancies between upper limb and speech motor control in PD.},

  abstract = {Lesion or degeneration of the cerebellum can profoundly impair adaptive control of reaching in humans. Computational models have proposed that internal models that help control movements form in the cerebellum and influence planned motor output through the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway. However, lesion studies of the cerebellar thalamus have not consistently found impairment in reaching or adaptation of reaching. To elucidate the role of the cerebellar thalamus in humans, we studied a group of essential tremor (ET) patients with deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes placed in the cerebellar thalamus. The stimulation can be turned on or off remotely and is thought to reduce tremor by blocking the spread of the pathological output from the cerebellum. We studied the effect of thalamic DBS on the ability to adapt arm movements to novel force fields. Although thalamic DBS resulted in a dramatic and significant reduction of tremor in ET, it also impaired motor adaptation: the larger the stimulation voltage, the greater the reduction in rates of adaptation. We next examined ET patients that had undergone unilateral thalamotomy in the cerebellar thalamus and found that adaptation with the contralateral arm was impaired compared with the ipsilateral arm. Therefore, although both lesion and electrical stimulation of the cerebellar thalamus are highly effective in reducing tremor, they significantly impair the ability of the brain to form internal models of action. Adaptive control of reaching appears to depend on the integrity of the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway.},

The rVA and rH45 neurons are located in the caudal and rostral margins of the medial column, respectively. These olivary neurons project as climbing fibers to the contralateral flocculus. In this study, injections of anterograde tracers into the medial column were used to investigate the zonal organization of the climbing fiber input to the flocculus of pigeons. Iontophoretic injections of either cholera toxin subunit-B or biotinylated dextrin amine were made into the medial column of the inferior olive at locations responsive to rVA or rH45 rotational optic flow. Anterogradely labeled climbing fibers in the flocculus showed a clear zonal organization. There were four parasagittal bands spanning both folia IXcd and X consisting of two rVA zones interdigitated with two rH45 zones.

  abstract = {The cerebellum is an evolutionarily conserved structure critical for motor learning in vertebrates. The model that has influenced much of the work in the field for the past 30 years suggests that motor learning is mediated by a single plasticity mechanism in the cerebellum: long-term depression (LTD) of parallel fiber synapses onto Purkinje cells. However, recent studies of simple behaviors such as the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) indicate that multiple plasticity mechanisms contribute to cerebellum-dependent learning. Multiple plasticity mechanisms may provide the flexibility required to store memories over different timescales, regulate the dynamics of movement, and allow bidirectional changes in movement amplitude. These plasticity mechanisms must act in combination with appropriate information-coding strategies to equip motor-learning systems with the ability to express learning in correct contexts. Studies of the patterns of generalization of motor learning in the VOR provide insight about the coding of information in neurons at sites of plasticity. These principles emerging from studies of the VOR are consistent with results concerning more complex behaviors and thus may reflect general principles of cerebellar function.},

The most thoroughly studied of these molecular markers is zebrin II (ZII; a.k.a. aldolase C). ZII is differentially expressed in Purkinje cells, resulting in a pattern of sagittal stripes of high expression interdigitated with stripes of little or no expression. In this study, we examined the expression of the calcium binding protein parvalbumin (PV) in the cerebellum of several avian species (pigeons, hummingbirds, zebra finches) and compared it to the expression of ZII. We found that PV immunoreactivity was distributed across the cerebellar cortex such that there were sagittal stripes of PV immunopositive (PV+) Purkinje cells alternating with PV immunonegative (PV-) Purkinje cells. Although most Purkinje cells in the anterior lobe were PV+, there were several thin (i.e. only a few Purkinje cells wide) PV- stripes spanning the folia. In the posterior lobe, PV+ and PV- stripes were also apparent, but the PV- stripes were much wider than in the anterior lobe. In sections processed for both ZII and PV, the expression was generally complementary: PV+ stripes were ZII-, and vice-versa. This complementary expression was most apparent in folia II-IV and VIII-IXcd. The complementary expression was not, however, absolute; some Purkinje cells co-expressed PV and ZII whereas others lacked both. These novel findings relate to the complex neurochemical organization of the cerebellum, and are likely important to issues regarding cerebellar plasticity.},

From all but the last of these, the projection is mainly crossed, though the uncrossed component from the lateral pontine nucleus is not insubstantial. The input from the superficial synencephalic nucleus provides a direct pathway from the retina to the cerebellum (folia VIc, VII, VIII and IXc). Less direct visual pathways reach the cerebellum via the following routes: (i) the superficial synencephalic nucleus projects ipsilaterally to the lateral pontine nucleus and sparsely to the inferior olive; (ii) the tectum projects ipsilaterally to the lateral and medial pontine nuclei, though the latter connection is sparse. In electrophysiological experiments, the importance of the tecto-pontine component of the projection has been demonstrated by cooling the tectum while recording visual responses from the cerebellum. The visual receptive fields of pontine cells have been analysed. They vary in extent from 10 degrees to the whole monocular field. They respond best to moving targets, preferring speeds of 20 to 60 degrees/second, and are usually direction-selective.},

These signals are encoded by spinal reflex circuits and conveyed to the cerebellar cortex through climbing fibre afferents.

  abstract = {The control of sequenced behaviors, including human speech, requires that the brain coordinate the production of discrete motor elements with their concatenation into complex patterns. In birdsong, another sequential vocal behavior, the acoustic structure (phonology) of individual song elements, or "syllables," must be coordinated with the sequencing of syllables into a song. However, it is unknown whether syllable phonology is independent of the sequence in which a syllable is produced. We quantified interactions between phonology and sequence in Bengalese finch song by examining both convergent syllables, which can be preceded by at least two different syllables and divergent syllables, which can be followed by at least two different syllables. Phonology differed significantly based on the identity of the preceding syllable for 97\% of convergent syllables and differed significantly with the identity of the upcoming syllable for 92\% of divergent syllables. Furthermore, sequence-dependent phonological differences extended at least two syllables away from the convergent or divergent syllable. To determine whether these phenomena reflect differences in central control, we analyzed premotor neural activity in the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA). Activity associated with a syllable varied significantly depending on the sequence in which the syllable was produced, suggesting that sequence-dependent variations in premotor activity contribute to sequence-dependent differences in phonology. Moreover, these data indicate that RA activity could contribute to the sequencing of syllables. Together, these results suggest that, rather than being controlled independently, the sequence and phonology of birdsong are intimately related, as is the case for human speech.},

  abstract = {In songbirds, the basal ganglia outflow nucleus LMAN is a cortical analog that is required for several forms of song plasticity and learning. Moreover, in adults, inactivating LMAN can reverse the initial expression of learning driven via aversive reinforcement. In the present study, we investigated how LMAN contributes to both reinforcement-driven learning and a self-driven recovery process in adult Bengalese finches. We first drove changes in the fundamental frequency of targeted song syllables and compared the effects of inactivating LMAN with the effects of interfering with N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent transmission from LMAN to one of its principal targets, the song premotor nucleus RA. Inactivating LMAN and blocking NMDA receptors in RA caused indistinguishable reversions in the expression of learning, indicating that LMAN contributes to learning through NMDA receptor-mediated glutamatergic transmission to RA. We next assessed how LMAN's role evolves over time by maintaining learned changes to song while periodically inactivating LMAN. The expression of learning consolidated to become LMAN independent over multiple days, indicating that this form of consolidation is not completed over one night, as previously suggested, and instead may occur gradually during singing. Subsequent cessation of reinforcement was followed by a gradual self-driven recovery of original song structure, indicating that consolidation does not correspond with the lasting retention of changes to song. Finally, for self-driven recovery, as for reinforcement-driven learning, LMAN was required for the expression of initial, but not later, changes to song. Our results indicate that NMDA receptor-dependent transmission from LMAN to RA plays an essential role in the initial expression of two distinct forms of vocal learning and that this role gradually wanes over a multiday process of consolidation. The results support an emerging view that cortical-basal ganglia circuits can direct the initial expression of learning via top-down influences on primary motor circuitry.},

We provided reinforcement contingent on fundamental frequency performance only at one point in the song. Learned changes to fundamental frequency were maximal at this point, but also extended both earlier and later in the fundamental frequency trajectory. A simple principle predicted the detailed structure of learning: birds learned to produce the average of the behavioral trajectories associated with successful outcomes. This learning rule accurately predicted the structure of learning at a millisecond timescale, demonstrating that the nervous system records fine-grained details of successful behavior and uses this information to guide learning.},

  abstract = {The cortical nucleus LMAN (lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium) provides the output of a basal ganglia pathway that is necessary for acquisition of learned vocal behavior during development in songbirds. LMAN is composed of two subregions, a core and a surrounding shell, that give rise to independent pathways that traverse the forebrain in parallel. The LMAN(shell) pathway forms a recurrent loop that includes a cortical region, the dorsal region of the caudolateral nidopallium (dNCL), hitherto unknown to be involved with learned vocal behavior. Here we show that vocal production strongly induces the IEG product ZENK in dNCL of zebra finches. Hearing tutor song while singing is more effective at inducing expression in dNCL of juvenile birds during the auditory-motor integration stage of vocal learning than is hearing conspecific song. In contrast, hearing conspecific song is relatively more effective at inducing expression in adult birds, regardless of whether they are producing song. Furthermore, ZENK+ neurons in dNCL include projection neurons that are part of the LMAN(shell) recurrent loop and a high proportion of dNCL projection neurons express ZENK in singing juvenile birds that hear tutor song. Thus juvenile birds that are actively refining their vocal pattern to imitate a tutor song show high levels of ZENK induction in dNCL neurons when they are singing while hearing the song of their tutor and low levels when they hear a novel conspecific. This pattern indicates that dNCL is a novel brain region involved with vocal learning and that its function is developmentally regulated.},

There are striking behavioural, neural and genetic similarities between auditory-vocal learning in birds and human infants. Recently, the linguistic parallels between birdsong and spoken language have begun to be investigated. Although both birdsong and human language are hierarchically organized according to particular syntactic constraints, birdsong structure is best characterized as 'phonological syntax', resembling aspects of human sound structure. Crucially, birdsong lacks semantics and words. Formal language and linguistic analysis remains essential for the proper characterization of birdsong as a model system for human speech and language, and for the study of the brain and cognition evolution.},

Despite the importance of categorical perception to learned vocal communication, the neural correlates underlying this phenomenon await identification. We found that individual sensorimotor neurons in freely behaving swamp sparrows expressed categorical auditory responses to changes in note duration, a learned feature of their songs, and that the neural response boundary accurately predicted the categorical perceptual boundary measured in field studies of the same sparrow population. Furthermore, swamp sparrow populations that learned different song dialects showed different categorical perceptual boundaries that were consistent with the boundary being learned. Our results extend the analysis of the neural basis of perceptual categorization into the realm of vocal communication and advance the learned vocalizations of songbirds as a model for investigating how experience shapes categorical perception and the activity of categorically responsive neurons.},

  abstract = {Birdsong is a learned motor skill that is performed with a high degree of stereotypy in adult birds. Nevertheless, even in species where song "crystallizes" in a form that remains stable over time, there is residual variability. Such variability in well-learned skills is often construed as uncontrolled and irrelevant biological "noise." However, studies in the zebra finch indicate that variability in one song feature--the structure of individual syllables--is actively regulated and may serve a function. When male zebra finches sing alone (undirected song), variability in syllable structure is elevated relative to when they sing to females in a courtship context (female-directed song). This elevated variability is actively introduced to premotor structures controlling syllable production by a forebrain-basal ganglia circuit. Here we test whether social modulation of song variability extends to syllable sequencing, a hierarchically distinct feature of song organization controlled by separate neural substrates from syllable structure. We use Bengalese finches as a model species because, unlike zebra finches, they typically retain substantial moment-by-moment variability in the sequencing of syllables in crystallized adult song. We first show social modulation of previously studied song features, including syllable structure and song tempo. We then demonstrate that variability in syllable sequencing is rapidly modulated by social context with greater variability present in undirected song. These data indicate that the nervous system exerts active control over variability at multiple levels of song organization and support the hypothesis that such variability in otherwise stable adult song serves a function.},

  abstract = {Area X is a songbird basal ganglia nucleus that is required for vocal learning. Both Area X and its immediate surround, the medial striatum (MSt), contain cells displaying either striatal or pallidal characteristics. We used pathway-tracing techniques to compare directly the targets of Area X and MSt with those of the lateral striatum (LSt) and globus pallidus (GP). We found that the zebra finch LSt projects to the GP, substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and pars compacta (SNc), but not the thalamus. The GP is reciprocally connected with the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and projects to the SNr and motor thalamus analog, the ventral intermediate area (VIA). In contrast to the LSt, Area X and surrounding MSt project to the ventral pallidum (VP) and dorsal thalamus via pallidal-like neurons. A dorsal strip of the MSt contains spiny neurons that project to the VP. The MSt, but not Area X, projects to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and SNc, but neither MSt nor Area X projects to the SNr. Largely distinct populations of SNc and VTA dopaminergic neurons innervate Area X and surrounding the MSt. Finally, we provide evidence consistent with an indirect pathway from the cerebellum to the basal ganglia, including Area X. Area X projections thus differ from those of the GP and LSt, but are similar to those of the MSt. These data clarify the relationships among different portions of the oscine basal ganglia as well as among the basal ganglia of birds and mammals.},

  abstract = {In addition to its key role in complex motor function, the cerebellum is increasingly recognized to have a role in cognition. Songbirds are particularly good models for the investigation of motor and cognitive processes but little is known about the role of the songbird cerebellum in these processes. To explore cerebellar function in a songbird, we lesioned the cerebellum of adult female zebra finches and examined the effects on a spatial working memory task and on motor function during this task. There is evidence for steroid synthesis in the songbird brain and neurosteroids may have an impact on some forms of neural plasticity in adult songbirds. We therefore hypothesized that neurosteroids would affect motor and cognitive function after a cerebellar injury. We found that cerebellar lesions produced deficits in motor and cognitive aspects of a spatial task. In line with our prediction, birds in which estrogen synthesis was blocked had impaired performance in our spatial task compared with those that had estrogen synthesis blocked but estrogen replaced. There was no clear effect of estrogen replacement on motor function. We also found that lesions induced expression of the estrogen synthetic enzyme aromatase in reactive astrocytes and Bergmann glia around a cerebellar lesion. These data suggest that the cerebellum of songbirds mediates both motor and cognitive function and that estrogens may improve the recovery of cognitive aspects of cerebellar function after injury.},

Over the past two decades, however, the question of a possible participation of the cerebellum in language processing itself has come to the forefront. In particular recent advances in our understanding of the neuroanatomy of the cerebellum combined with evidence from functional neuroimaging, neurophysiological and neuropsychological research, have extended our view of the cerebellum from that of a simple coordinator of autonomic and somatic motor function. Rather it is now more widely accepted that the cerebellum, and in particular the right cerebellar hemisphere, participates in modulation of cognitive functioning, especially to those parts of the brain to which it is reciprocally connected. The present paper reviews the neuroanatomical, clinical and functional neuroimaging evidence suggestive of a role for the cerebellum in language processing. The possible neuropathophysiological substrates of language impairment associated with cerebellar pathology are discussed and the nature of the linguistic deficits associated with disease or damage to the cerebellum described.},

  abstract = {Vocalization is a complex behaviour pattern, consisting of essentially three components: laryngeal activity, respiratory movements and supralaryngeal (articulatory) activity. The motoneurones controlling this behaviour are located in various nuclei in the pons (trigeminal motor nucleus), medulla (facial nucleus, nucl. ambiguus, hypoglossal nucleus) and ventral horn of the spinal cord (cervical, thoracic and lumbar region). Coordination of the different motoneurone pools is carried out by an extensive network comprising the ventrolateral parabrachial area, lateral pontine reticular formation, anterolateral and caudal medullary reticular formation, and the nucl. retroambiguus. This network has a direct access to the phonatory motoneurone pools and receives proprioceptive input from laryngeal, pulmonary and oral mechanoreceptors via the solitary tract nucleus and principal as well as spinal trigeminal nuclei. The motor-coordinating network needs a facilitatory input from the periaqueductal grey of the midbrain and laterally bordering tegmentum in order to be able to produce vocalizations. Voluntary control of vocalization, in contrast to completely innate vocal reactions, such as pain shrieking, needs the intactness of the forebrain. Voluntary control over the initiation and suppression of vocal utterances is carried out by the mediofrontal cortex (including anterior cingulate gyrus and supplementary as well as pre-supplementary motor area). Voluntary control over the acoustic structure of vocalizations is carried out by the motor cortex via pyramidal/corticobulbar as well as extrapyramidal pathways. The most important extrapyramidal pathway seems to be the connection motor cortex-putamen-substantia nigra-parvocellular reticular formation-phonatory motoneurones. The motor cortex depends upon a number of inputs for fulfilling its task. It needs a cerebellar input via the ventrolateral thalamus for allowing a smooth transition between consecutive vocal elements. It needs a proprioceptive input from the phonatory organs via nucl. ventralis posterior medialis thalami, somatosensory cortex and inferior parietal cortex. It needs an input from the ventral premotor and prefrontal cortex, including Broca's area, for motor planning of longer purposeful utterances. And it needs an input from the supplementary and pre-supplementary motor area which give rise to the motor commands executed by the motor cortex. Copyright ?? 2002 .},

  abstract = {Despite the conservative circuitry of the cerebellum, there is considerable variation in the shape of the cerebellum among vertebrates. One aspect of cerebellar morphology that is of particular interest is the degree of folding, or foliation, of the cerebellum and its functional significance. Here, we present the first comprehensive analysis of variation in cerebellar foliation in birds with the aim of determining the effects that allometry, phylogeny and development have on species differences in the degree of cerebellar foliation. Using both conventional and phylogenetically based statistics, we assess the effects of these variables on cerebellar foliation among 91 species of birds. Overall, our results indicate that allometry exerts the strongest effect and accounts for more than half of the interspecific variation in cerebellar foliation. In addition, we detected a significant phylogenetic effect. A comparison among orders revealed that several groups, corvids, parrots and seabirds, have significantly more foliated cerebella than other groups, after accounting for allometric effects. Lastly, developmental mode was weakly correlated with relative cerebellar foliation, but incubation period and fledging age were not. From our analyses, we conclude that allometric and phylogenetic effects exert the strongest effects and developmental mode a weak effect on avian cerebellar foliation. The phylogenetic distribution of highly foliated cerebella also suggests that cognitive and/or behavioral differences play a role in the evolution of the cerebellum.},

  abstract = {The integration of two neural pathways generates learned song in zebra finches. The vocal motor pathway (VMP) is a direct connection between HVC (proper name) and the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA), whereas the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP) comprises an indirect circuit from HVC to RA that traverses the basal ganglia. Partial ablation (microlesion) of HVC in adult birds alters the integration of VMP and AFP synaptic input within RA and destabilizes singing. However, the vocal pattern shows surprising resilience because birds subsequently recover their song in approximately 1 week. Here, we show that deafening prevents vocal recovery after HVC microlesions, indicating that birds require auditory feedback to restore/relearn their vocal patterns. We then tested the role of the AFP (basal ganglia circuit) in this feedback-based recovery by ablating the output nucleus of the AFP [lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (LMAN)]. We found that LMAN ablation after HVC microlesions induced a sudden recovery of the vocal pattern. Thus, the AFP cannot be the neural locus of an instructive/learning mechanism that uses auditory feedback to guide vocal recovery, at least in this form of adult vocal plasticity. Instead, the AFP appears to be the source of the variable motor patterns responsible for vocal destabilization. In part, auditory feedback may restore song by strengthening the VMP component of synaptic input to RA relative to the AFP component.},

  abstract = {In songbirds, as in mammals, basal ganglia-forebrain circuits are necessary for the learning and production of complex motor behaviors; however, the precise role of these circuits remains unknown. It has recently been shown that a basal ganglia-forebrain circuit in the songbird, which projects directly to vocal-motor circuitry, has a premotor function driving exploration necessary for vocal learning. It has also been hypothesized that this circuit, known as the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP), may generate an instructive signal that improves performance in the motor pathway. Here, we show that the output of the AFP directly implements a motor correction that reduces vocal errors. We use disruptive auditory feedback, contingent on song pitch, to induce learned changes in song structure over the course of hours and find that reversible inactivation of the output of the AFP produces an immediate regression of these learned changes. Thus, the AFP is involved in generating an error-reducing bias, which could increase the efficiency of vocal exploration and instruct synaptic changes in the motor pathway. We also find that learned changes in the song generated by the AFP are incorporated into the motor pathway within 1 day. Our observations support a view that basal ganglia-related circuits directly implement behavioral adaptations that minimize errors and subsequently stabilize these adaptations by training premotor cortical areas.},

Understanding the mechanisms by which the brain organizes this complex temporal behaviour is a central motivation in the study of the song control and learning system. Here we present evidence that, in addition to central neural control, a further level of temporal organization is provided by nonlinear oscillatory dynamics that are intrinsic to the avian vocal organ. A detailed temporal and spectral examination of song of the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) reveals a class of rapid song modulations that are consistent with transitions in the dynamical state of the syrinx. Furthermore, in vitro experiments show that the syrinx can produce a sequence of oscillatory states that are both spectrally and temporally complex in response to the slow variation of respiratory or syringeal parameters. As a consequence, simple variations in a small number of neural signals can result in a complex acoustic sequence.},

Understanding how a vocal mimic copies another species' song may provide an insight into whether there are alternative motor mechanisms for generating the model's song and what parts of his song are most difficult to produce. We show here that when a vocal mimic, the northern mockingbird, accurately copies the song of another species it also uses the vocal motor pattern employed by the model species. Deviations from the model's production mechanism result in predictable differences in the mockingbird's song. Species-specific acoustic features of the model seem most difficult to copy, suggesting that they have been exposed to the strongest selective pressure to maximize their performance.},

  abstract = {The diverse vocal signals of songbirds are produced by highly coordinated motor patterns of syringeal and respiratory muscles. These muscles control separate sound generators on the right and left side of the duplex vocal organ, the syrinx. Whereas most song is under active neural control, there has been a growing interest in a different class of nonlinear vocalizations consisting of frequency jumps, subharmonics, biphonation and deterministic chaos that are also present in the vocal repertoires of many vertebrates, including many birds. These nonlinear phenomena may not require active neural control, depending instead on the intrinsic nonlinear dynamics of the oscillators housed within each side of the syrinx. This study investigates the occurrence of these phenomena in the vocalizations of intact northern mockingbirds Mimus polyglottos. By monitoring respiratory pressure and airflow on each side of the syrinx, we provide the first analysis of the contribution made by each side of the syrinx to the production of nonlinear phenomena and are able to reliably discriminate two-voice vocalizations from potentially similar appearing, unilaterally produced, nonlinear events. We present the first evidence of syringeal lateralization of nonlinear dynamics during bilaterally produced chaotic calls. The occurrence of unilateral nonlinear events was not consistently correlated with fluctuations in air sac pressure or the rate of syringeal airflow. Our data support previous hypotheses for mechanical and acoustic coupling between the two sides of the syrinx. These results help lay a foundation upon which to understand the communicative functions of nonlinear phenomena.},

The syntax is gradually lost over a period of days after deafening and is recovered when hearing is restored. We present a spiking neuronal network model of the song syntax generation and its loss, based on the assumption that the syntax is stored in reafferent connections from the auditory to the motor control area. Propagating synfire activity in the HVC codes for individual syllables of the song and priming signals from the auditory network reduce the competition between syllables to allow only those transitions that are permitted by the syntax. Both imprinting of song syntax within HVC and the interaction of the reafferent signal with an efference copy of the motor command are sufficient to explain the gradual loss of syntax in the absence of auditory feedback. The model also reproduces for the first time experimental findings on the influence of altered auditory feedback on the song syntax generation, and predicts song- and species-specific low frequency components in the LFP. This study illustrates how sequential compositionality following a defined syntax can be realized in networks of spiking neurons.},

  abstract = {Songbirds use a complex network of discrete brain areas and connecting fiber tracts to sing their song, but our knowledge of this circuitry may be incomplete. The forebrain area, "caudal mesopallium" (CM), has received much attention recently for its song-related activities. HVC, a prominent song system nucleus, projects to a restricted area of the CM known as the avalanche nucleus (Av). However, the other connections of Av remain unknown. Here we used tract-tracing methods to examine the connections of Av to other song system nuclei. Injections of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) into Av labeled both afferent terminals and neurons in HVC and the interfacial nucleus of the nidopallium (NIf), suggesting that there is complex feedforward and feedback communication between these nuclei (HVC{$<$}--{$>$}Av{$<$}--{$>$}NIf). Labeled neurons were also found in the uvaeform nucleus (Uva), which was substantiated by BDA injections into Uva that labeled terminals in Av. Double fluorescent tracing experiments confirm that both HVC and Uva project to Av. The present study adds complex new connections that expand the traditional song system circuitry into the caudal mesopallium. These new pathways are likely to have broad implications for deciphering how this intricate system works.},

  abstract = {Many of the most distinctive attributes of our species are a product of our brains. To understand the function, development, variability, and evolution of the human brain, we must engage with the field of neuroscience. Neuroscientific methods can be used to investigate research topics that are of special interest to anthropologists, such as the neural bases of primate behavioral diversity, human brain evolution, and human brain development. Traditional neuroscience methods had to rely on investigation of postmortem brains, as well as invasive studies in living nonhuman primates. However, recent neuroimaging methods have made it possible to compare living human and nonhuman primate brains using noninvasive techniques such as structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and diffusion tensor imaging. These methods are providing an integrated picture of brain structure and function that was not previously available. With a combination of these traditional and modern neuroscience methods, we are beginning to explore and understand the neural bases of some of the most distinctive cognitive and behavioral attributes of the human species, including language, tool use, altruism, and mental self-projection, and we can now begin to propose plausible scenarios by which the neural substrates supporting these human specializations evolved from pre-existing neural circuitry serving related functions in common ancestors we shared with the living nonhuman primates. Consideration of the process of neurodevelopment suggests plausible mechanisms by which the highly encephalized human brain might have evolved. Neurodevelopmental studies also demonstrate that experience can shape both brain structure and function, providing a mechanism by which people of different cultures learn to act and think differently. Finally, not only can anthropologists benefit from neuroscience, neuroscience can benefit from the more sophisticated concept of evolution that anthropology offers, including an appreciation of evolutionary diversity as well as consideration of the process by which the human brain was formed during evolution.},

We have developed an experimental paradigm in which brief arousal repeatedly suppresses song system auditory responsiveness. Using pharmacological manipulations in vivo, we show that infusion of alpha-adrenergic antagonists into the NIf (nucleus interfacialis of the nidopallium), an auditory forebrain area, blocks this state-dependent modulation. We also demonstrate dose-dependent enhancement and suppression of song system auditory response properties by NE and adrenergic agonists. Our results demonstrate that noradrenergic release in a single forebrain area is a mechanism underlying behavioral state-dependent regulation of auditory processing in a neural system specialized for vocal learning.},

The role of Uva in influencing HVC auditory activity is unknown. Using in vivo extracellular and intracellular recordings in urethane-anesthetized zebra finches, we characterized the auditory properties of Uva and examined its influence on auditory activity in HVC and in the telencephalic nucleus interface (NIf), the main auditory afferent of HVC and a corecipient of Uva input. We found robust auditory activity in Uva and determined that Uva is innervated by the ventral nucleus of lateral lemniscus, an auditory brainstem component. Thus, Uva provides a direct linkage between the auditory brainstem and HVC. Although low-frequency electrical stimulation in Uva elicited short-latency depolarizing postsynaptic potentials in HVC neurons, reversibly silencing Uva exerted little effect on BOS-evoked activity in HVC neurons. However, high-frequency stimulation in Uva suppressed auditory-evoked synaptic and suprathreshold activity in all HVC neuron types, a process accompanied by decreased input resistance of individual HVC neurons. Furthermore, high-frequency stimulation in Uva simultaneously suppressed auditory activity in HVC and NIf. These results suggest that Uva can gate auditory responses in HVC through a mechanism that involves inhibition local to HVC as well as withdrawal of auditory-evoked excitatory drive from NIf. Thus, Uva could play an important role in state-dependent gating of auditory activity in telencephalic sensorimotor structures important to learned vocal control.},

  abstract = {To generate complex bilateral motor patterns such as those underlying birdsong, neural activity must be highly coordinated across the two cerebral hemispheres. However, it remains largely elusive how this coordination is achieved given that interhemispheric communication between song-control areas in the avian cerebrum is restricted to projections received from bilaterally connecting areas in the mid- and hindbrain. By electrically stimulating cerebral premotor areas in zebra finches, we find that behavioral effectiveness of stimulation rapidly switches between hemispheres. In time intervals in which stimulation in one hemisphere tends to distort songs, stimulation in the other hemisphere is mostly ineffective, revealing an idiosyncratic form of motor dominance that bounces back and forth between hemispheres like a virtual ping-pong ball. The intervals of lateralized effectiveness are broadly distributed and are unrelated to simple spectral and temporal song features. Such interhemispheric switching could be an important dynamical aspect of neural coordination that may have evolved from simpler pattern generator circuits.},

Little is known, however, about ascending brainstem control of forebrain motor structures. Here, we provide the first evidence for bottom-up activation of forebrain motor centers by the respiratory brainstem. We show that, in the avian vocal control system, activation of the brainstem inspiratory nucleus paraambigualus (PAm), a likely homolog of the mammalian rostral ventral respiratory group, can drive neural activity bilaterally in the forebrain vocal control nuclei HVC (used as a proper name) and the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA). Furthermore, this activation is abolished by lesions of nucleus uvaeformis (Uva), a thalamic nucleus necessary for song production. We identify a type of bursting neuron within PAm whose activity is correlated, in an Uva dependent manner, to bursting activity in RA, rather than to the respiratory rhythm, and is robustly active during the production of stimulus evoked vocalizations. Because this ascending input results in cross-hemisphere activation, our results suggest a crucial role for the respiratory brainstem in coordinating forebrain motor centers during vocal production.},

  abstract = {Synaptic interactions between telencephalic neurons innervating descending motor or basal ganglia pathways are essential in the learning, planning, and execution of complex movements. Synaptic interactions within the songbird telencephalic nucleus HVC are implicated in motor and auditory activity associated with learned vocalizations. HVC contains projection neurons (PNs) (HVC(RA)) that innervate song premotor areas, other PNs (HVC(X)) that innervate a basal ganglia pathway necessary for vocal plasticity, and interneurons (HVC(INT)). During singing, HVC(RA) fire in temporally sparse bursts, possibly because of HVC(INT)-HVC(RA) interactions, and a corollary discharge can be detected in the basal ganglia pathway, likely because of synaptic transmission from HVC(RA) to HVC(X) cells. During song playback, local interactions, including inhibition onto HVC(X) cells, shape highly selective responses that distinguish HVC from its auditory afferents. To better understand the synaptic substrate for the motor and auditory properties of HVC, we made intracellular recordings from pairs of HVC neurons in adult male zebra finch brain slices and used spike-triggered averages to assess synaptic connectivity. A major synaptic interaction between the PNs was a disynaptic inhibition from HVC(RA) to HVC(X), which could link song motor signals in the two outputs of HVC and account for some of the song playback-evoked inhibition in HVC(X) cells. Furthermore, single interneurons made divergent connections onto PNs of both types, and either PN type could form reciprocal connections with interneurons. In these two regards, the synaptic architecture of HVC resembles that described in some pattern-generating networks, underscoring features likely to be important to singing and song learning.},

Affected individuals can be free of symptoms for years, but rapidly develop persistent dystonia and Parkinsonism-like symptoms after a stressful experience. Using a mouse model, we found that an adverse interaction between the cerebellum and basal ganglia can account for the symptoms of these individuals. The primary instigator of dystonia was the cerebellum, whose aberrant activity altered basal ganglia function, which in turn caused dystonia. This adverse interaction between the cerebellum and basal ganglia was mediated through a di-synaptic thalamic pathway that, when severed, alleviated dystonia. Our results provide a unifying hypothesis for the involvement of cerebellum and basal ganglia in the generation of dystonia and suggest therapeutic strategies for the treatment of RDP.},

  abstract = {Substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) GABAergic neurons are key output neurons of the basal ganglia. Given the role of these neurons in motor control, it is important to understand factors that regulate their firing rate and pattern. One potential regulator is hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), a reactive oxygen species that is increasingly recognized as a neuromodulator. We used whole-cell current clamp recordings of SNr GABAergic neurons in guinea-pig midbrain slices to determine how H(2)O(2) affects the activity of these neurons and to explore the classes of ion channels underlying those effects. Elevation of H(2)O(2) levels caused an increase in the spontaneous firing rate of SNr GABAergic neurons, whether by application of exogenous H(2)O(2) or amplification of endogenous H(2)O(2) through inhibition of glutathione peroxidase with mercaptosuccinate. This effect was reversed by flufenamic acid (FFA), implicating transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. Conversely, depletion of endogenous H(2)O(2) by catalase, a peroxidase enzyme, decreased spontaneous firing rate and firing precision of SNr neurons, demonstrating tonic control of firing rate by H(2)O(2). Elevation of H(2)O(2) in the presence of FFA revealed an inhibition of tonic firing that was prevented by blockade of ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channels with glibenclamide. In contrast to guinea-pig SNr neurons, the dominant effect of H(2)O(2) elevation in mouse SNr GABAergic neurons was hyperpolarization, indicating a species difference in H(2)O(2)-dependent regulation. Thus, H(2)O(2) is an endogenous modulator of SNr GABAergic neurons, acting primarily through presumed TRP channels in guinea-pig SNr, with additional modulation via K(ATP) channels to regulate SNr output.},

  abstract = {In many species, courtship signals enhance reproductive function in the receiver. How these social signals are processed by the brain, particularly how they induce an endocrine response, is not well understood. Songbirds provide an ideal model in which to study this phenomenon because of the large existing literature on both their auditory neurobiology and the control of their reproductive physiology by environmental cues. To date, all of the relevant studies on songbirds have involved measuring the effects of male vocalizations on ovarian function over a period of weeks, a time course that precludes detailed analysis of the neuroendocrine mechanisms operating during song perception. We played recordings of conspecific male song to laboratory-housed female white-throated sparrows and quantified the resulting rapid changes in LH as well as the induction of the immediate early gene Egr-1 in the GnRH system and mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH). Hearing song for 42 min induced LH release and Egr-1 expression in the MBH, but did not alter Egr-1 expression in GnRH neurons. The time course of LH release and the pattern of Egr-1 expression together suggest that song acts as a trigger to induce GnRH release in a manner resembling photostimulation. The Egr-1 response in the MBH was qualitatively distinguishable from the responses to either photostimulation or pharmacologically induced LH release but seemed to involve overlapping neuronal populations. Song-induced Egr-1 expression in the MBH was correlated with the expression in midbrain and forebrain auditory centers, further supporting a role for the MBH in processing social information.},

  abstract = {When neuronal activity is reduced over a period of days, compensatory changes in synaptic strength and/or cellular excitability are triggered, which are thought to act in a manner to homeostatically recover normal activity levels. The time course over which changes in homeostatic synaptic strength and cellular excitability occur are not clear. Although many studies show that 1-2 days of activity block are necessary to trigger increases in excitatory quantal strength, few studies have been able to examine whether these mechanisms actually underlie recovery of network activity. Here, we examine the mechanisms underlying recovery of embryonic motor activity following block of either excitatory GABAergic or glutamatergic inputs in vivo. We find that GABA(A) receptor blockade triggers fast changes in cellular excitability that occur during the recovery of activity but before changes in synaptic scaling. This increase in cellular excitability is mediated in part by an increase in sodium currents and a reduction in the fast-inactivating and calcium-activated potassium currents. These findings suggest that compensatory changes in cellular excitability, rather than synaptic scaling, contribute to activity recovery. Further, we find a special role for the GABA(A) receptor in triggering several homeostatic mechanisms after activity perturbations, including changes in cellular excitability and GABAergic and AMPAergic synaptic strength. The temporal difference in expression of homeostatic changes in cellular excitability and synaptic strength suggests that there are multiple mechanisms and pathways engaged to regulate network activity, and that each may have temporally distinct functions.},

  abstract = {When activity levels are altered over days, a network of cells is capable of recognizing this perturbation and triggering several distinct compensatory changes that should help to recover and maintain the original activity levels homeostatically. One feature commonly observed after activity blockade has been a compensatory increase in excitatory quantal amplitude. The sensing machinery that detects altered activity levels is a central focus of the field currently, but thus far it has been elusive. The vast majority of studies that reduce network activity also reduce neurotransmission. We address the possibility that reduced neurotransmission can trigger increases in quantal amplitude. In this work, we blocked glutamatergic or GABA(A) transmission in ovo for 2 days while maintaining relatively normal network activity. We found that reducing GABA(A) transmission triggered compensatory increases in both GABA and AMPA quantal amplitude in embryonic spinal motoneurons. Glutamatergic blockade had no effect on quantal amplitude. Therefore, GABA binding to the GABA(A) receptor appears to be a critical step in the sensing machinery for homeostatic synaptic plasticity. The findings suggest that homeostatic increases in quantal amplitude may normally be triggered by reduced levels of activity, which are sensed in the developing spinal cord by GABA, via the GABA(A) receptor. Therefore, GABA appears to be serving as a proxy for activity levels.},

The results showed that met-enkephalin was present in the Ov shell and most of the areas connected to it, but not in the Ov core. Anterograde and retrograde tracing studies showed that the Ov shell was more widely connected than the Ov core. The Ov shell was mainly connected to: 1). areas flanking the primary telencephalic auditory field (i.e., fields L2b, L1, and L3) and areas surrounding the robust nucleus of the archistriatum (RA); 2). several hypothalamic areas such as the nucleus ventromedialis hypothalami (VMN) and the nucleus anterior medialis hypothalami (AM). Some of these areas connected to the Ov shell are thought to be involved in auditory mediated neurosecretory activities. These results, which are similar to those reported previously in non-songbirds, suggest that the Ov shell and other surrounding areas of auditory and song-control nuclei are conserved in birds. These findings are discussed in terms of the evolution of the core-and-surround organization of auditory and song-control nuclei.},

The Ov-SPO surround received a projection from a cell group along the interface of the auditory midbrain and the n. intercollicularis, as revealed with PHAL and biocytin, and was composed of neurons exhibiting a common morphology. These features and the presence of overlapping projections from different portions of the Ov-SPO surround suggest that this region comprises a functionally discrete area, which we term the Ov shell. Single unit recording within the shell established the existence of acoustically responsive units. Both PHAL and fluorogold labeling revealed a robust projection from the Ov shell to the caudomedial hypothalamus. Major telencephalic projections of the shell terminated within the ventral paleostriatal complex, "end-zones" of the field L, the caudomedial hyperstriatum ventrale, and regions immediately dorsal and lateral to the auditory neostriatum. Except for a portion of the shell bordering medial ovoidalis, PHAL injections into the shell also labeled fibers within the caudolateral neostriatum and along the lateral neostriatal rim. The connectivity of the Ov shell suggests that this region may integrate auditory pathways with brain regions associated with endocrine mediated behavior. In addition, the shell may constitute a source of converging input to several levels of central auditory pathways.},

Bengalese finches have been domesticated in Japan for 240 years. Comparing their song syntax with that of their wild ancestors, we found that the domesticated strain has highly complex, conspicuous songs with finite-state syntax, while the wild ancestor sang very stereotyped linear songs. To examine the functional utility of the song complexity, we compared serum levels of estradiol and measured the amount of nesting materials carried into the nest by female birds that were stimulated with either the complex "domesticated" song or the simple wild-type song. In the females stimulated with complex songs the estradiol levels were significantly higher and the amount of nesting material carried was significantly greater. We then performed brain lesions in the song system to identify the neural substrates that are responsible for these differences in song behavior. In Bengalese finches lesions of NIf, a higher order song control nucleus, resulted in simplification of the complex song syntax. That is, the complex "domesticated" syntax changed into the simple wild-type syntax. Based on these data, we hypothesize that mutations in the song control nuclei have occurred that enabled complex song syntax and became fixed into the population of domesticated Bengalese finches through a process of indirect sexual selection.},

Our results indicate that Bengalese finches change the amplitude of undirected song based on background noise levels, but do not do so for directed song.

The similarity in electrophysiological properties unambiguously indicates that the thalamocortical system must be as ancient as the vertebrate branch itself. We address the view that rather than simply relays, thalamic neurons have sui generis intrinsic electrical properties that govern their specific functional dynamics and regulate natural functional states such as sleep and vigilance. In addition, thalamocortical activity has been shown to be involved in the genesis of several neuropsychiatric conditions collectively described as thalamocortical dysrhythmia syndrome.},

Single-channel and macroscopic current behavior have been carefully investigated and kinetic schemes devised to completely describe the activation and inactivation processes. The kinetic properties of T current lead to activation of low-threshold spikes subsequent to transient membrane hyperpolarizations. Putative functional roles for T current include generation of low-threshold spikes that lead to burst firing, promotion of intrinsic oscillatory behavior, boosting of calcium entry, and synaptic potentiation.},

  abstract = {Giant inhibitory terminals with multiple synapses, the counterparts of excitatory "detonator" or "driver" terminals, have not been described in the forebrain. Using three-dimensional reconstructions of electron microscopic images, we quantitatively characterize a GABAergic pathway that establishes synaptic contacts exclusively via multiple synapses. Axon terminals of the nigrothalamic pathway formed, on average, 8.5 synapses on large-diameter dendrites and somata of relay cells in the ventromedial nucleus of the rat thalamus. All synapses of a given terminal converged on a single postsynaptic element. The vast majority of the synapses established by a single terminal were not separated by astrocytic processes. Nigrothalamic terminals in the macaque monkey showed the same ultrastructural features both in qualitative and quantitative terms (the median number of synapse per target was also 8.5). The individual synapses were closely spaced in both species. The nearest-neighbor synaptic distances were 169 nm in the rat and 178 nm in the monkey. The average number of synapses within 0.75 microm from any given synapse was 3.8 in the rat and 3.5 in the monkey. The arrangement of synapses described in this study creates favorable conditions for intersynaptic spillover of GABA among the multiple synapses of a single bouton, which can result in larger charge transfer. This could explain faithful and efficient GABAergic signal transmission in the nigrothalamic pathway in the healthy condition and during Parkinson's disease. In addition, our structural data suggest that the rodent nigrothalamic pathway can be a valid model of the primate condition, when the mechanism of GABAergic transmission is studied.},

  abstract = {Presynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are present in many regions of the brain and potentially serve as targets for the pharmacological action of nicotine in vivo. To investigate their mechanism of action, we performed patch-clamp recordings in relay neurons from slices of thalamus sensory nuclei. In these nuclei, nAChR activation facilitated the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Micromolar concentrations of nicotinic agonists increased the frequency of miniature GABAergic synaptic currents and decreased the failure rate of evoked synaptic currents. These actions of nicotinic agonists were not observed in knock-out mice lacking the beta 2 nAChR subunit gene. Nicotinic effects were dependent on extracellular calcium ions, and they persisted when calcium was replaced by strontium or barium but not by magnesium. Furthermore, in high extracellular calcium concentrations, nicotinic agonists evoked an increase in spontaneous release lasting for minutes after removal of the agonist. This supports the view that presynaptic nAChRs facilitate the release of neurotransmitter by increasing the calcium concentrations in presynaptic nerve endings. With use of cadmium and nickel ions as selective blockers, it was found that in different sensory nuclei the presynaptic influx of calcium could result either from the activation of voltage-dependent calcium channels or from a direct influx through nAChR channels. Finally, we propose that the nicotinic facilitation of GABAergic transmission may contribute to the increase of signal-to-noise ratio observed in the thalamus in vivo during arousal.},

  abstract = {The mammalian thalamus is composed of two types of thalamocortical relay. First order relays receive information from subcortical sources and relay it to cortex, whereas higher order relays receive information from layer 5 of one cortical area and relay it to another. Recent reports suggest that modulatory inputs to first and higher order relays may differ. We used rat thalamic brain slices and whole cell recordings from relay cells in various first order (the lateral geniculate nucleus, the ventral posterior nucleus, and the ventral portion of the medial geniculate body) and higher order (the lateral posterior, the posterior medial nucleus, and the dorsal portion of the medial geniculate body) relays to explore their responses to activation of muscarinic receptors. We found that, whereas all first order relay cells show a depolarizing response to muscarinic activation, approximately 20\% of higher order relay cells respond with hyperpolarization. The depolarization is accompanied by an overall increase in input resistance, whereas the hyperpolarization correlates with a decrease in resistance. Because activation of cholinergic brain stem afferents to thalamus increases with increasing behavioral vigilance, the findings suggest that increased vigilance will depolarize all first order and most higher order relay cells but will hyperpolarize a significant subset of higher order relay cells. Such hyperpolarization is expected to bias these relay cells to the burst firing mode, and so these results are consistent with evidence of more bursting among higher order than first order relay cells.},

Here we show the effects of night-sleep on song development in the zebra finch by recording and analysing the entire song ontogeny. During periods of rapid learning we observed a pronounced deterioration in song structure after night-sleep. The song regained structure after intense morning singing. Daily improvement in similarity to the tutored song occurred during the late phase of this morning recovery; little further improvement occurred thereafter. Furthermore, birds that showed stronger post-sleep deterioration during development achieved a better final imitation. The effect diminished with age. Our experiments showed that these oscillations were not a result of sleep inertia or lack of practice, indicating the possible involvement of an active process, perhaps neural song-replay during sleep. We suggest that these oscillations correspond to competing demands of plasticity and consolidation during learning, creating repeated opportunities to reshape previously learned motor skills.},

Techniques were developed for inducing the rapid onset of song imitation in young zebra finches and for tracking trajectories of vocal change over a 7-week period until a match to a model song was achieved. Exposure to a model song induced the prompt generation of repeated structured sounds (prototypes) followed by a slow transition from repetitive to serial delivery of syllables. Tracking this transition revealed two phenomena: (i) Imitations of dissimilar sounds can emerge from successive renditions of the same prototype, and (ii) developmental trajectories for some sounds followed paths of increasing acoustic mismatch until an abrupt correction occurred by period doubling. These dynamics are likely to reflect underlying neural and articulatory constraints on the production and imitation of sounds.},

  abstract = {Conductance-based neuron models are frequently employed to study the dynamics of biological neural networks. For speed and ease of use, these models are often reduced in morphological complexity. Simplified dendritic branching structures may process inputs differently than full branching structures, however, and could thereby fail to reproduce important aspects of biological neural processing. It is not yet well understood which processing capabilities require detailed branching structures. Therefore, we analyzed the processing capabilities of full or partially branched reduced models. These models were created by collapsing the dendritic tree of a full morphological model of a globus pallidus (GP) neuron while preserving its total surface area and electrotonic length, as well as its passive and active parameters. Dendritic trees were either collapsed into single cables (unbranched models) or the full complement of branch points was preserved (branched models). Both reduction strategies allowed us to compare dynamics between all models using the same channel density settings. Full model responses to somatic inputs were generally preserved by both types of reduced model while dendritic input responses could be more closely preserved by branched than unbranched reduced models. However, features strongly influenced by local dendritic input resistance, such as active dendritic sodium spike generation and propagation, could not be accurately reproduced by any reduced model. Based on our analyses, we suggest that there are intrinsic differences in processing capabilities between unbranched and branched models. We also indicate suitable applications for different levels of reduction, including fast searches of full model parameter space.},

  abstract = {Synchronization of globus pallidus (GP) neurons and cortically entrained oscillations between GP and other basal ganglia nuclei are key features of the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. Phase response curves (PRCs), which tabulate the effects of phasic inputs within a neuron's spike cycle on output spike timing, are efficient tools for predicting the emergence of synchronization in neuronal networks and entrainment to periodic input. In this study we apply physiologically realistic synaptic conductance inputs to a full morphological GP neuron model to determine the phase response properties of the soma and different regions of the dendritic tree. We find that perisomatic excitatory inputs delivered throughout the interspike interval advance the phase of the spontaneous spike cycle yielding a type I PRC. In contrast, we demonstrate that distal dendritic excitatory inputs can either delay or advance the next spike depending on whether they occur early or late in the spike cycle. We find this latter pattern of responses, summarized by a biphasic (type II) PRC, was a consequence of dendritic activation of the small conductance calcium-activated potassium current, SK. We also evaluate the spike-frequency dependence of somatic and dendritic PRC shapes, and we demonstrate the robustness of our results to variations of conductance densities, distributions, and kinetic parameters. We conclude that the distal dendrite of GP neurons embodies a distinct dynamical subsystem that could promote synchronization of pallidal networks to excitatory inputs. These results highlight the need to consider different effects of perisomatic and dendritic inputs in the control of network behavior.},

A burst given at the peak of theta induces homosynaptic LTP; the same burst at a trough induces homosynaptic LTD of previously potentiated synapses. Heterosynaptic LTD is produced at inactive synapses when others undergo LTP. The synaptic modifications during theta require NMDA receptors and muscarinic receptors. The enhancement is cooperative and occludes with standard LTP. These results suggest that the similar bursts observed during theta rhythm in vivo may be a natural stimulus for inducing LTP/LTD.},

We found that the subthreshold membrane potential is characterized by a large, rapid depolarization 5-10 ms before burst onset, consistent with a synaptically connected chain of neurons in HVC. We found no evidence for the slow membrane potential modulation predicted by models in which burst timing is controlled by subthreshold dynamics. Furthermore, bursts ride on an underlying depolarization of {$\sim$}10-ms duration, probably the result of a regenerative calcium spike within HVC neurons that could facilitate the propagation of activity through a chain network with high temporal precision.

In contrast, the vocal organ is driven continuously by smoothly varying muscle control signals. To investigate how the sparse HVC code is transformed into continuous vocal patterns, we recorded in the singing zebra finch from populations of neurons in the robust nucleus of arcopallium (RA), a premotor area intermediate between HVC and the motor neurons. We found that highly similar song elements are typically produced by different RA ensembles. Furthermore, although the song is modulated on a wide range of time scales (10-100 ms), patterns of neural activity in RA change only on a short time scale (5-10 ms). We suggest that song is driven by a dynamic circuit that operates on a single underlying clock, and that the large convergence of RA neurons to vocal control muscles results in a many-to-one mapping of RA activity to song structure. This permits rapidly changing RA ensembles to drive both fast and slow acoustic modulations, thereby transforming the sparse HVC code into a continuous vocal pattern.},

Songbirds provide a marvelous animal model in which to study these phenomena. By use of a motorized microdrive to record the activity of single neurons in the singing bird, we are beginning to understand the circuits that generate complex vocal sequences. We describe recent experiments elucidating the role of premotor song-control nucleus HVC in the production of song. We find that HVC neurons projecting to premotor nucleus RA each generate a single burst of spikes at a particular time in the song and may form a sparse representation of temporal order. We incorporate this observation into a working hypothesis for the generation of vocal sequences in the songbird, and examine some implications for song learning.},

  abstract = {In mammalian basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits, GABAergic pallidal neurons are thought to "gate" or modulate excitation in thalamus with their strong inhibitory inputs and thus signal to cortex by pausing and permitting thalamic neurons to fire in response to excitatory drive. In contrast, in a homologous circuit specialized for vocal learning in songbirds, evidence suggests that pallidal neurons signal by eliciting postinhibitory rebound spikes in thalamus, which could occur even without any excitatory drive to thalamic neurons. To test whether songbird pallidal neurons can also communicate with thalamus by gating excitatory drive, as well as by postinhibitory rebound, we examined the activity of thalamic relay neurons in response to acute inactivation of the basal ganglia structure Area X; Area X contains the pallidal neurons that project to thalamus. Although inactivation of Area X should eliminate rebound-mediated spiking in thalamus, this manipulation tonically increased the firing rate of thalamic relay neurons, providing evidence that songbird pallidal neurons can gate tonic thalamic excitatory drive. We also found that the increased thalamic activity was fed forward to its target in the avian equivalent of cortex, which includes neurons that project to the vocal premotor area. These data raise the possibility that basal ganglia circuits can signal to cortex through thalamus both by generating postinhibitory rebound and by gating excitatory drive and may switch between these modes depending on the statistics of pallidal firing. Moreover, these findings provide insight into the strikingly different disruptive effects of basal ganglia and cortical lesions on songbird vocal learning.},

Although the importance of auditory feedback to vocal learning is well established, whether and how feedback signals influence vocal premotor circuitry has remained obscure. Previous studies in singing birds have not detected changes to vocal premotor activity after perturbations of auditory feedback, leading to the hypothesis that contributions of feedback to vocal plasticity might rely on"offline" processing. Here, we recorded single and multiunit activity in the premotor nucleus HVC (proper name) of singing Bengalese finches in response to feedback perturbations that are known to drive plastic changes in song. We found that transient feedback perturbation caused reliable decreases in HVC activity at short latencies (20-80 ms). Similar changes to HVC activity occurred in awake, nonsinging finches when the bird's own song was played back with auditory perturbations that simulated those experienced by singing birds. These data indicate that neurons in avian vocal premotor circuitry are rapidly influenced by perturbations of auditory feedback and support the possibility that feedback information in HVC contributes "online" to the production and plasticity of vocalizations.},

Evidence strongly indicates that auditory feedback contributes in real time to human speech, but similar contributions of feedback to birdsong remain unclear. Here, we assessed real-time influences of auditory feedback on Bengalese finch song using a computerized system to detect targeted syllables as they were being sung and to disrupt feedback transiently at short and precisely controlled latencies. Altered feedback elicited changes within tens of milliseconds to both syllable sequencing and timing in ongoing song. These vocal disruptions were larger when feedback was altered at segments of song with variable sequence transitions than at stereotyped sequences. As in humans, these effects depended on the feedback delay relative to ongoing song, with the most disruptive delays approximating the average syllable duration. These results extend the parallels between speech and birdsong with respect to a moment-by-moment reliance on auditory feedback. Moreover, they demonstrate that song premotor circuitry is sensitive to auditory feedback during singing and suggest that feedback may contribute in real time to the control and calibration of song.},

Previous work has suggested that the strength and duration of inhibitory input determines the synchrony and period, respectively, of these oscillations. In particular, sleep spindles result from a cycle of events including rhythmic inhibition and rebound bursts in thalamocortical (TC) neurons, and slowing and strengthening this inhibitory input may transform spindles into spike-wave discharges characteristic of absence epilepsy. Here, we used dynamic clamp to inject TC neurons with spindle-like trains of IPSCs and studied how modest changes in the amplitude and/or duration of these IPSCs affected the responses of the TC neurons. Contrary to our expectations, we found that prolonging IPSCs accelerates postinhibitory rebound (PIR) in TC neurons, and that increasing either the amplitude or duration of IPSCs desynchronizes PIR activity in a population of TC cells. Tonic injection of hyperpolarizing or depolarizing current dramatically alters the timing and synchrony of PIR. These results demonstrate that rhythmic PIR activity is an emergent property of interactions between intrinsic and synaptic currents, not just a passive reflection of incoming synaptic inhibition.},

  abstract = {Understanding how neural activity in sensory cortices relates to perception is a central theme of neuroscience. Action potentials of sensory cortical neurons can be strongly correlated to properties of sensory stimuli and reflect the subjective judgements of an individual about stimuli. Microstimulation experiments have established a direct link from sensory activity to behaviour, suggesting that small neuronal populations can influence sensory decisions. However, microstimulation does not allow identification and quantification of the stimulated cellular elements. The sensory impact of individual cortical neurons therefore remains unknown. Here we show that stimulation of single neurons in somatosensory cortex affects behavioural responses in a detection task. We trained rats to respond to microstimulation of barrel cortex at low current intensities. We then initiated short trains of action potentials in single neurons by juxtacellular stimulation. Animals responded significantly more often in single-cell stimulation trials than in catch trials without stimulation. Stimulation effects varied greatly between cells, and on average in 5\% of trials a response was induced. Whereas stimulation of putative excitatory neurons led to weak biases towards responding, stimulation of putative inhibitory neurons led to more variable and stronger sensory effects. Reaction times for single-cell stimulation were long and variable. Our results demonstrate that single neuron activity can cause a change in the animal's detection behaviour, suggesting a much sparser cortical code for sensations than previously anticipated.},

  abstract = {Songbirds, which, like humans, learn complex vocalizations, provide an excellent model for the study of acoustic pattern recognition. Here we examined the role of three basic acoustic parameters in an ethologically-relevant categorization task. Female zebra finches were first trained to classify songs as belonging to one of two males, and then asked whether they could generalize this knowledge to songs systematically altered with respect to frequency, timing, or intensity. Birds' performance on song categorization fell off rapidly when songs were altered in frequency or intensity, but they generalized well to songs that were changed in duration by more than 25\%. Birds were not deaf to timing changes, however; they detected these tempo alterations when asked to discriminate between the same song played back at two different speeds. In addition, when birds were retrained with songs at many intensities, they could correctly categorize songs over a wide range of volumes. Thus, although they can detect all these cues, birds attend less to tempo than to frequency or intensity cues during song categorization. These results are unexpected for several reasons: (1) zebra finches normally encounter a wide range of song volumes, but most failed to generalize across volumes in this task; (2) males produce only slight variations in tempo, but females generalized widely over changes in song duration; (3) all three acoustic parameters are critical for auditory neurons. Thus, behavioral data place surprising constraints on the relationship between previous experience, behavioral task, neural responses, and perception. We discuss implications for models of auditory pattern recognition.},

  abstract = {Calcium-triggered fusion of synaptic vesicles and neurotransmitter release are fundamental signalling steps in the central nervous system. It is generally assumed that fast transmitter release is triggered by elevations in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) to at least 100 microM near the sites of vesicle fusion. For synapses in the central nervous system, however, there are no experimental estimates of this local [Ca2+]i signal. Here we show, by using calcium ion uncaging in the large synaptic terminals of the calyx of Held, that step-like elevations to only 10 microM [Ca2+]i induce fast transmitter release, which depletes around 80\% of a pool of available vesicles in less than 3 ms. Kinetic analysis of transmitter release rates after [Ca2+]i steps revealed the rate constants for calcium binding and vesicle fusion. These show that transient (around 0.5 ms) local elevations of [Ca2+]i to peak values as low as 25 microM can account for transmitter release during single presynaptic action potentials. The calcium sensors for vesicle fusion are far from saturation at normal release probability. This non-saturation, and the high intracellular calcium cooperativity in triggering vesicle fusion, make fast synaptic transmission very sensitive to modulation by changes in local [Ca2+]i.},

The origins of this pathophysiology are poorly defined for the generation of pacemaking. After the induction of a parkinsonian state in mice, there was a progressive decline in autonomous GPe pacemaking, which normally serves to desynchronize activity. The loss was attributable to the downregulation of an ion channel that is essential in pacemaking, the hyperpolarization and cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel. Viral delivery of HCN2 subunits restored pacemaking and reduced burst spiking in GPe neurons. However, the motor disability induced by dopamine (DA) depletion was not reversed, suggesting that the loss of pacemaking was a consequence, rather than a cause, of key network pathophysiology, a conclusion that is consistent with the ability of L-type channel antagonists to attenuate silencing after DA depletion.},

  abstract = {The brain easily generates the movement that is needed in a given situation. Yet surprisingly, the results of experimental studies suggest that it is difficult to acquire more than one skill at a time. To do so, it has generally been necessary to link the required movement to arbitrary cues. In the present study, we show that speech motor learning provides an informative model for the acquisition of multiple sensorimotor skills. During training, subjects were required to repeat aloud individual words in random order while auditory feedback was altered in real-time in different ways for the different words. We found that subjects can quite readily and simultaneously modify their speech movements to correct for these different auditory transformations. This multiple learning occurs effortlessly without explicit cues and without any apparent awareness of the perturbation. The ability to simultaneously learn several different auditory-motor transformations is consistent with the idea that, in speech motor learning, the brain acquires instance-specific memories. The results support the hypothesis that speech motor learning is fundamentally local.},

  abstract = {When planning goal-directed reaches, subjects must estimate the position of the arm by integrating visual and proprioceptive signals from the sensory periphery. These integrated position estimates are required at two stages of motor planning: first to determine the desired movement vector, and second to transform the movement vector into a joint-based motor command. We quantified the contributions of each sensory modality to the position estimate formed at each planning stage. Subjects made reaches in a virtual reality environment in which vision and proprioception were dissociated by shifting the location of visual feedback. The relative weighting of vision and proprioception at each stage was then determined using computational models of feedforward motor control. We found that the position estimate used for movement vector planning relies mostly on visual input, whereas the estimate used to compute the joint-based motor command relies more on proprioceptive signals. This suggests that when estimating the position of the arm, the brain selects different combinations of sensory input based on the computation in which the resulting estimate will be used.},

Experiments 1 and 2 examined the effect of background noise level (Lombard effect) and the effect of manipulating feedback level from self-produced vocalizations (Fletcher effect), respectively. Results show that birds exhibit both a Lombard effect and a Fletcher effect. Further analysis showed that changes in vocal intensity were accompanied by changes in call fundamental frequency and duration. Experiment 3 tested the effect of delaying or altering auditory feedback during vocal production. Results showed subsequent production of incomplete and distorted calls in both feedback conditions. These distortions included changes in the peak fundamental frequency, amplitude, duration, and spectrotemporal structure of calls. Delayed auditory feedback was most disruptive to subsequent calls when the delay was 25 ms. Longer delays resulted in fewer errors.},

A new approach to patch-clamp recordings enabled us to characterize the integrative properties of these cells. Despite the short physical length of rat basal dendrites, synaptic inputs were electrotonically remote from the soma ({$>$}30-fold excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) attenuation) and back-propagating action potentials were significantly attenuated. Unitary EPSPs were location dependent, reaching large amplitudes distally ({$>$}8 mV), yet their somatic contribution was relatively location independent. Basal dendrites support sodium and NMDA spikes, but not calcium spikes, for 75\% of their length. This suggests that basal dendrites, despite their proximity to the site of action potential initiation, do not form a single basal-somatic region but rather should be considered as a separate integrative compartment favoring two integration modes: subthreshold, location-independent summation versus local amplification of incoming spatiotemporally clustered information.},

We found that dendritic EPSP amplitude increases with distance from the soma, counterbalancing the filtering effects of the dendrites and reducing the location dependence of somatic EPSP amplitude. Dendritic current injections and a multi-compartmental computer model demonstrated that dendritic membrane properties have only a minor role in elevating the local EPSP.

Here, we combined in vivo intracellular recordings with computational models to investigate EEG-activated states induced by stimulation of the brain stem ascending arousal system. Electrical stimulation of the pedonculopontine tegmental (PPT) nucleus produced long-lasting (approximately 20 s) periods of desynchronized EEG activity similar to the EEG of awake animals. Intracellularly, PPT stimulation locked the membrane into a depolarized state, similar to the up-states seen during deep anesthesia. During these EEG-activated states, however, the input resistance was higher than that during up-states. Conductance measurements were performed using different methods, which all indicate that EEG-activated states were associated with a synaptic activity dominated by inhibitory conductances. These results were confirmed by computational models of reconstructed pyramidal neurons constrained by the corresponding intracellular recordings. These models indicate that, during EEG-activated states, neocortical neurons are in a high-conductance state consistent with a stochastic integrative mode. The amplitude and timing of somatic excitatory postsynaptic potentials were nearly independent of the position of the synapses in dendrites, suggesting that EEG-activated states are compatible with coding paradigms involving the precise timing of synaptic events.},

At depolarized membrane potentials, thalamic cells fire single action potentials and faithfully relay synaptic inputs to the cortex. At hyperpolarized potentials, the activation of T-type calcium channels promotes burst firing, and the transfer is less accurate. Our results suggest that this duality no longer holds if synaptic background activity is taken into account. By injecting stochastic conductances into guinea-pig thalamocortical neurons in slices, we show that the transfer function of these neurons is strongly influenced by conductance noise. The combination of synaptic noise with intrinsic properties gives a global responsiveness that is more linear, mixing single-spike and burst responses at all membrane potentials. Because in thalamic neurons, background synaptic input originates mainly from cortex, these results support a determinant role of corticothalamic feedback during sensory information processing.},

Since the striato-nigrothalamic circuit is composed of two successive GABAergic inhibitory links and the SNR is tonically active, we tested that by inhibiting nigrothalamic cells, the striatum may exert a facilitatory influence on VM-thalamocortical cells. We show that a transitory block of SNR (substantia nigra pars reticulata) firing (induced by either intranigral application of GABA or by stimulating the inhibitory striato-nigral pathway), causes a perfectly time-locked increase of activity in a large number of VM cells projecting to motor cortex. Moreover, the striatally evoked excitation of VM-thalamocortical cells requires the functional integrity of the GABAergic striato-nigral link. We conclude that the double inhibitory striato-nigrothalamic pathway acts on VM-thalamocortical cells through a disinhibitory mechanism. The functional implication of such a mechanism is discussed.},

We show that high-frequency, random activation of this GABAergic synapse can drive precisely timed firing in DLM neurons in brain slices in the absence of excitatory input. Complex IPSP trains, including spike trains recorded in vivo, drive spiking in slices with high reproducibility, even between animals. Using a simple model, we can predict much of DLM's response to natural stimulus trains.

Yet in apparent conflict with this model, the globus pallidus, a GABAergic basal ganglia output structure, often exhibits marked increases in firing rate during movement. To investigate the translation of pallidal activity and its relay through the thalamus, we explored a basal ganglia-thalamic pathway essential for song learning in songbirds. We found that single units in the thalamic nucleus DLM of urethane-anesthetized adult male zebra finches responded selectively to playback of the bird's own song, like neurons in its upstream and downstream nuclei. Because the pallidal input to these neurons forms giant calyx-like synapses, we were able to record extracellular signals from these presynaptic terminals as well. Pallidal units were distinctly excited by song playback, suggesting an increase in GABAergic transmission in the thalamus during sensory processing. However, this overall increased firing rate was phasic, punctuated by rapid decelerations in firing rate. In several cases, we were able to record presynaptic and postsynaptic units simultaneously. Correlating the presynaptic and postsynaptic activity, we found that disinhibition of thalamus may entail pallidal firing rate decelerations rather than simple long pauses in spontaneous activity, as has long been assumed.},

  abstract = {Cerebellar nucleus neurons were recorded in vitro, and dynamic clamping was used to simulate inhibitory synaptic input from Purkinje cells likely to occur in vivo. Inhibitory input patterns with varying synaptic amplitudes and synchronicity were applied to determine how spike rate and spike timing can be controlled by inhibition. The excitatory input conductance was held constant to isolate the effect of dynamic inhibitory inputs on spiking. We found that the timing of individual spikes was controlled precisely by short decreases in the inhibitory conductance that were the consequence of synchronization between many inputs. The spike rate of nucleus neurons was controlled in a linear way by the rate of inhibitory inputs. The spike rate, however, also depended strongly on the amount of synchronicity present in the inhibitory inputs. An irregular spike train similar to in vivo data resulted from applied synaptic conductances when the conductance was large enough to overcome intrinsic pacemaker currents. In this situation subthreshold fluctuations in membrane potential closely followed the time course of the combined reversal potential of excitation and inhibition. This indicates that the net synaptic driving force for realistic input levels in vivo may be small and that synaptic input may operate primarily by shunting. The accurate temporal control of output spiking by inhibitory input that can be achieved in this way in the deep cerebellar nuclei may be particularly important to allow fine temporal control of movement via inhibitory output from cerebellar cortex.},

Recent findings suggest the presence of two principal modes of synchronised activity within the human subthalamo-pallidal-thalamo-cortical circuit, at {$<$}30 Hz and {$>$}60 Hz. These oscillations are dynamically and systematically modulated by task, thereby suggesting a functional role in movement. More importantly, the two frequency modes are inversely affected by movement, consistent with opposing actions, and differentially expressed according to the prevailing level of dopaminergic activity. It is argued that the balance between these modes determines the effects of basal ganglia-thalamocortical projections on the motor areas of the cortex. The lower frequency oscillations facilitate slow idling rhythms in the motor areas of the cortex, whereas synchronisation at high frequency restores dynamic task-related cortical ensemble activity in the gamma band.},

This activity contains information about the underlying network dynamics, but it is not easy to extract network properties from such complex and irregular activity. Here, we propose a method to estimate properties of network activity from intracellular recordings and test this method using theoretical and experimental approaches. The method is based on the analytic expression of the subthreshold V(m) distribution at steady state in conductance-based models. Fitting this analytic expression to V(m) distributions obtained from intracellular recordings provides estimates of the mean and variance of excitatory and inhibitory conductances. We test the accuracy of these estimates against computational models of increasing complexity. We also test the method using dynamic-clamp recordings of neocortical neurons in vitro. By using an on-line analysis procedure, we show that the measured conductances from spontaneous network activity can be used to re-create artificial states equivalent to real network activity. This approach should be applicable to intracellular recordings during different network states in vivo, providing a characterization of the global properties of synaptic conductances and possible insight into the underlying network mechanisms.},

  abstract = {We performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in vitro to investigate the integration of excitatory and inhibitory inputs in neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) by applying synthetic synaptic input patterns with dynamic clamping. We explored an input regime in which excitation and inhibition had an ongoing baseline rate because both input pathways show ongoing activity in vivo. We found that spiking was time-locked to transients in the inputs, consisting of brief decreases in inhibitory or increases in excitatory conductance. Such input transients were caused by synchronization among multiple inputs. However, we found that temporal synchrony in the inhibitory input pathway had preferential access to the control of DCN spiking, because the large NMDA component of the excitatory inputs smoothed out temporal transients in this pathway. Thus, synaptic integration in the DCN appears to be tuned to allow the cerebellar cortical output from Purkinje cells preferential access to the control of DCN spiking. The effect of temporal modulations in the inhibition was further enhanced by the voltage dependence of the NMDA inputs. Thus, the presence of a baseline of mossy and climbing fiber inputs boosted depolarizing responses caused by reduced inhibition by the voltage-dependent increase in inward NMDA current. Overall, our results show that correlated activity or pauses in populations of Purkinje cells are well suited to the dynamic control of DCN spiking. In addition, strong transients in excitation can directly drive DCN responses that bypass cerebellar cortical processing.},

  abstract = {The low-threshold calcium current (IT) underlies burst generation in thalamocortical (TC) relay cells and plays a central role in the genesis of synchronized oscillations by thalamic circuits. Here we have combined in vitro recordings and computational modeling techniques to investigate the consequences of dendritically located IT in TC cells. Simulations of a reconstructed TC cell were compared with the recordings obtained in the same cell to constrain the values of its passive parameters. T-current densities in soma and proximal dendrites were then estimated by matching the model to voltage-clamp recordings obtained in dissociated TC cells, which lack most of the dendrites. The distal dendritic T-current density was constrained by recordings in intact TC cells, which show 5-14 times larger peak T-current amplitudes compared with dissociated cells. Comparison of the model with the recordings of the same cell constrained further the T-current density in dendrites, which had to be 4.5-7.6 times higher than in the soma to reproduce all experimental results. Similar conclusions were reached using a simplified three-compartment model. Functionally, the model shows that the same amount of T-channels can lead to different bursting behaviors if they are exclusively somatic or distributed throughout the dendrites. In conclusion, this combination of models and experiments shows that dendritic T-currents are necessary to reproduce low-threshold calcium electrogenesis in TC cells. Dendritic T-current may also have significant functional consequences, such as an efficient modulation of thalamic burst discharges by corticothalamic feedback.},

In healthy monkeys, only 11\% (20/174) of the GPe cells and 3\% (1/29) of the GPi cells displayed significant 3-19 Hz oscillations. After MPTP treatment, 39\% (107/271) of the GPe cells and 43\% (26/61) of the GPi cells developed significant oscillations. Oscillation frequencies of single cells after MPTP treatment were bimodally distributed around 7 and 13 Hz. For 10\% of the oscillatory cells that were recorded during tremor periods, there was a significant tendency for the tremor and neuronal oscillations to appear simultaneously. Cross-correlation analysis revealed a very low level of correlated activity between pallidal neurons in the normal state; 95.6\% (477/499) of the pairs were not correlated, and oscillatory cross-correlograms were found in only 1\% (5/499) of the pairs. After MPTP treatment, the correlations increased dramatically, and 40\% (432/1080) of the cross-correlograms had significant oscillations, centered around 13-14 Hz. Phase shifts of the cross-correlograms of GPe pairs, but not of GPi, were clustered around 0 degrees. The results illustrate that MPTP treatment changes the pattern of activity and synchronization in the GPe and GPi. These changes are related to the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and especially to the parkinsonian tremor.},

  abstract = {The electroresponsive properties of guinea-pig thalamic neurones were studied using an in vitro slice preparation. A total of 650 cells were recorded intracellularly comprising all regions of the thalamus; of these 229 fulfilled our criterion for recording stability and were used as the data base for this report. The resting membrane potential for thirty-four representative neurones which were analysed in detail was -64 +/- 5 mV (mean +/- S.D.), input resistance 42 +/- 18 M omega, and action potential amplitude 80 +/- 7 mV. Intracellular staining with horseradish peroxidase and Lucifer Yellow revealed that the recorded cells had different morphology. In some their axonal trajectory characterized them as thalamo-cortical relay cells. Two main types of neuronal firing were observed. From a membrane potential negative to -60 mV, anti- or orthodromic and direct activation generated a single burst of spikes, consisting of a low-threshold spike (l.t.s.) of low amplitude and a set of fast superimposed spikes. Tonic repetitive firing was observed if the neurones were activated from a more positive membrane potential; this was a constant finding in all but two of the cells which fulfilled the stability criteria. The l.t.s. response was totally inactivated at membrane potentials positive to -55 mV. As the membrane was hyperpolarized from this level the amplitude of the l.t.s. increased and became fully developed at potentials negative to -70 mV. This increase is due to a de-inactivation of the ionic conductance generating this response. After activation the l.t.s. showed refractoriness for approximately 170 ms. Deinactivation of l.t.s. is a voltage- and time-dependent process; full de-inactivation after a step hyperpolarization to maximal l.t.s. amplitude (-75 to -80 mV) requires 150-180 ms. Membrane depolarization positive to -55 mV generated sudden sustained depolarizing 'plateau potentials', capable of supporting repetitive firing (each action potential being followed by a marked after-hyperpolarization, a.h.p.). The a.h.p. and the plateau potential controlled the voltage trajectory during the interspike interval and, with the fast spike, constitute a functional state where the thalamic neurone displayed oscillatory properties. Frequency-current (f-I) plots from different initial levels of membrane potential were obtained by the application of square current pulses of long duration (2s). From resting membrane potential and from hyperpolarized levels a rather stereotyped onset firing rate was observed due to the presence of the l.t.s.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Here, evidence is reviewed which shows that drugs acting on a variety of neurotransmitter systems can indeed enhance cognition, and to a lesser extent mood and pro-social behavior. Moreover, it seems possible to interfere with the (re)consolidation of traumatic memories. There are, however, a number of caveats: first, as cognition-enhancing drugs can simultaneously exert both linear and quadratic (U-shaped) effects, doses most effective in facilitating one behavior could at the same time exert null or even detrimental effects on other cognitive domains. Second, individuals with a 'low memory span' might benefit from cognition-enhancing drugs, whereas 'high span subjects' are 'overdosed'. And finally, evidence suggests that a number of trade-offs could occur. For example, increases of cognitive stability might come at the cost of a decreased capacity to flexibly alter behavior. A short overview of ethical issues raised by the use of cognition and mood enhancing drugs demonstrates the tremendous variety in views and opinions regarding the subject.},

  abstract = {Sex steroids facilitate dramatic changes in behavioral responses to sociosexual signals and are increasingly implicated in the sensory processing of those signals. Our previous work demonstrated that in female white-throated sparrows, which are seasonal breeders, genomic responses in the auditory forebrain are selective for conspecific song over frequency-matched tones only when plasma estradiol (E2) reaches breeding levels. Here, we sought to map this E2-dependent selectivity in the best-studied area of the auditory forebrain, the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM). Nonbreeding females with low endogenous levels of E2 were treated with E2 or a placebo and exposed to conspecific song, tones, or no sound playback. Immunoreactive protein product of the immediate early gene zenk (egr-1) was then quantified within seven distinct subregions, or domains, of NCM. We report three main findings: (1) regardless of hormone treatment, the zenk response is significantly higher in dorsal than in ventral NCM, and higher in medial than in lateral NCM; (2) E2-dependent selectivity of the response is limited to the rostral and medial domains of NCM; in the more caudal domains, song induces more zenk expression than tones regardless of hormone treatment; (3) even when no sound stimuli were presented, E2 treatment significantly increased zenk expression in the rostral, but not the caudal, domains of NCM. Together, the latter two findings suggest that E2-dependent plasticity in NCM is concentrated in rostral NCM, which is hodologically and neurochemically distinct from caudal NCM. Activity in rostral NCM may therefore be seasonally regulated in this species.},

Mammals have both sex steroid binding globulin (SSBG) and corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG). Birds, however, have no detectable SSBG, leading to the early conclusion that birds have no plasma regulation of sex steroids. CBG, however, can bind androgens with relatively high affinity. In birds, therefore, the control of androgenic effects may be tightly regulated by glucocorticoid physiology because glucocorticoids compete with androgens for CBG binding sites. We report levels of total testosterone (T), total corticosterone, CBG, and estimated free T in the males, the more aggressive morph had higher levels of total T; female morphs did not differ. Approximately 96\% of T was bound to CBG, but a lack of morph or sex-specific differences in corticosterone titers or CBG capacity caused patterns of free T to mirror those of total T. While CBG has the potential to greatly influence T availability to tissues, in this species interactions between T, CBG and corticosterone do not appear to alter general patterns of T availability to tissues.},

Comparative chromosome painting and cytogenetic mapping of 15 zebra finch BAC clones to the standard (ZAL2) and alternative (ZAL2(m)) arrangements revealed that this chromosome is orthologous to chicken chromosome 3, and that at a minimum, ZAL2 and ZAL2(m) differ by a pair of included pericentric inversions that we estimate span at least 98 Mb. Population-based sequencing and genotyping of multiple loci demonstrated that ZAL2(m) suppresses recombination in the heterokaryotype and is evolving as a rare nonrecombining autosomal segment of the genome. In addition, we estimate that the first inversion within the ZAL2(m) arrangement originated 2.2+/-0.3 million years ago. Finally, while previously recognized as a genetic model for the evolution of social behavior, we found that the ZAL2/ZAL2(m) polymorphism also shares genetic and phenotypic features with the mouse t complex and we further suggest that the ZAL2/ZAL2(m) polymorphism is a heretofore unrecognized model for the early stages of sex chromosome evolution.},

  abstract = {Many vertebrate species exhibit alternative phenotypes (or morphs), in which one sex displays phenotypic variation equal to or greater than the variation between the sexes. Males in such species typically display differences in reproductive strategies and morphology. Steroid hormones such as testosterone are known modulators of reproductive behavior and morphology and therefore are obvious candidates for the mediation of phenotypic differences between morphs. We conducted a year-round study in the white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis) that exhibits alternative phenotypes in plumage coloration and behavior in both sexes: during the breeding season, white-striped males and females are more aggressive and have higher song rates than tan-striped individuals. At the beginning of the breeding season, free-living white-striped males had higher plasma testosterone concentrations than tan-striped males. However, this finding might have been due to different social experiences because captive male morphs sampled at similar times of year did not differ in testosterone concentrations. Captive white-striped males had larger testis and cloacal protuberance sizes than tan-striped males, which might be related to the divergent mating strategies of the morphs. Male morphs showed similar increases in luteinizing hormone following injections of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, but white-striped males showed larger increases in testosterone, indicating differences between morphs in gonadal testosterone production. Females had low concentrations of testosterone, and morphs did not differ. Plasma dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) concentrations were elevated in both sexes and morphs during the breeding and non-breeding seasons. These data do not support the hypothesis that testosterone activates behavioral differences between alternative phenotypes in the white-throated sparrow. Alternative testable hypotheses include hormonal effects during early development and direct genetic effects.},

  abstract = {Chromosomal inversions have been of long-standing interest to geneticists because they are capable of suppressing recombination and facilitating the formation of adaptive gene complexes. An exceptional inversion polymorphism (ZAL2(m)) in the white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis) is linked to variation in plumage, social behavior and mate choice, and is maintained in the population by negative assortative mating. The ZAL2(m) polymorphism is a complex inversion spanning {$>$}100 Mb and has been proposed to be a strong suppressor of recombination, as well as a potential model for studying neo-sex chromosome evolution. To quantify and evaluate these features of the ZAL2(m) polymorphism, we generated sequence from 8 ZAL2(m) and 16 ZAL2 chromosomes at 58 loci inside and 4 loci outside the inversion. Inside the inversion we found that recombination was completely suppressed between ZAL2 and ZAL2(m), resulting in uniformly high levels of genetic differentiation (F(ST)=0.94), the formation of two distinct haplotype groups representing the alternate chromosome arrangements and extensive linkage disequilibrium spanning approximately 104 Mb within the inversion, whereas gene flow was not suppressed outside the inversion. Finally, although ZAL2(m) homozygotes are exceedingly rare in the population, occurring at a frequency of {$<$}1\%, we detected evidence of historical recombination between ZAL2(m) chromosomes inside the inversion, refuting its potential status as a non-recombining autosome.Heredity advance online publication, 23 June 2010; doi:10.1038/hdy.2010.85.},

  abstract = {Birdsong is a learned behavior remarkable for its high degree of stereotypy. Nevertheless, adult birds display substantial rendition-by-rendition variation in the structure of individual song elements or "syllables." Previous work suggests that some of this variation is actively generated by the avian basal ganglia circuitry for purposes of motor exploration. However, it is unknown whether and how natural variations in premotor activity drive variations in syllable structure. Here, we recorded from the premotor nucleus robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) in Bengalese finches and measured whether neural activity covaried with syllable structure across multiple renditions of individual syllables. We found that variations in premotor activity were significantly correlated with variations in the acoustic features (pitch, amplitude, and spectral entropy) of syllables in approximately a quarter of all cases. In these cases, individual neural recordings predicted 8.5 +/- 0.3\% (mean +/- SE) of the behavioral variation, and in some cases accounted for 25\% or more of trial-by-trial variations in acoustic output. The prevalence and strength of neuron-behavior correlations indicate that each acoustic feature is controlled by a large ensemble of neurons that vary their activity in a coordinated manner. Additionally, we found that correlations with pitch (but not other features) were predominantly positive in sign, supporting a model of pitch production based on the anatomy and physiology of the vocal motor apparatus. Collectively, our results indicate that trial-by-trial variations in spectral structure are indeed under central neural control at the level of RA, consistent with the idea that such variation reflects motor exploration.},

We found that, similar to human speech, adult birdsong is maintained by error correction. We perturbed the pitch (fundamental frequency) of auditory feedback in adult Bengalese finches using custom-designed headphones. Birds compensated for the imposed auditory error by adjusting the pitch of song. When the perturbation was removed, pitch returned to baseline. Our results indicate that adult birds correct vocal errors by comparing auditory feedback to a sensory target and suggest that lifelong error correction is a general principle of learned vocal behavior.},

Individuals with a white stripe (WS) on the crown engage in an aggressive strategy that involves more singing, whereas individuals with a tan stripe (TS) sing less and engage in more parental care. Previous work has shown that plasma levels of gonadal steroids differ between the morphs in both sexes, suggesting a hormonal mechanism for the polymorphic behavior in this species. Here, we eliminated morph differences in plasma levels of testosterone (T) in males and estradiol (E2) in females in order to test whether morph differences in behavior would be similarly eliminated. Males and females in non-breeding condition were treated with T or E2, respectively, so that plasma levels in the treated groups were high and equal between the WS and TS morphs. We found that despite hormone treatment, WS and TS birds differed with respect to singing behavior. WS males sang more in response to song playback than did TS males, and WS females exhibited more spontaneous song than TS females. We also found that WS males gave more chip calls, which are often used in contexts of territorial aggression. Overall, these results suggest that WS birds engage in more territorial vocalization, particularly song, than do TS birds, even when T or E2 levels are experimentally equalized. This behavioral difference may therefore be driven by other factors, such as steroid metabolism, receptor expression or function, or steroid-independent neurotransmitter systems.},

The present study measures the volumes of several nuclei in the avian song system and relates these to color morph and to sex. We find that robustus archistristalis and the tracheosyringeal part of the hypoglossal nucleus, nuclei closely involved in song production, are larger in white-striped than in tan-striped birds. We also find morph differences for nuclei in the rostral division of the song system, nuclei believed to be less directly involved in song production.

  abstract = {Behavioral responses to sociosexual signals often depend on gonadal steroid hormones, which are thought to modulate behavior by acting on motivational systems in the brain. There is mounting evidence that sex steroids may also modulate perception of sociosexual signals by affecting sensory processing. In seasonally breeding songbirds such as the white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis), the female's behavioral response to hearing male song depends on her plasma levels of estradiol (E2). Here, we examined whether plasma E2 also affects the selectivity of the song-induced zenk (egr-1) response in the auditory forebrain, which is known to vary according to the behavioral relevance of song stimuli. Non-breeding females were held on a winter-like photoperiod and implanted with silastic capsules containing either no hormone or E2. E2-treated birds hearing 42 min of conspecific song had more cells immunoreactive for the protein product of zenk in the auditory forebrain than did those hearing frequency-matched synthetic tones. In birds not treated with E2, however, the zenk response to song did not differ from that to tones. We found similar effects in the avian homolog of the inferior colliculus, indicating that E2 may affect the processing of auditory information upstream of the forebrain. Our data suggest that in females, zenk induction in the auditory system is selective for song only when plasma E2 exceeds non-breeding levels. E2-dependent plasticity of auditory pathways and processing centres may promote recognition of and attention to conspecific song during the breeding season.},

Recently, reports from several research groups have converged to show that estradiol also powerfully modulates sensory processing, specifically, the physiology of central auditory circuits in songbirds. These investigators have discovered that (1) behaviorally-relevant auditory experience rapidly increases estradiol levels in the auditory forebrain; (2) estradiol instantaneously enhances the responsiveness and coding efficiency of auditory neurons; (3) these changes are mediated by a non-genomic effect of brain-generated estradiol on the strength of inhibitory neurotransmission; and (4) estradiol regulates biochemical cascades that induce the expression of genes involved in synaptic plasticity. Together, these findings have established estradiol as a central regulator of auditory function and intensified the need to consider brain-based mechanisms, in addition to peripheral organ dysfunction, in hearing pathologies associated with estrogen deficiency.},

  abstract = {Life history trade-offs can drive the evolution of alternative phenotypes, the expression of which is usually under hormonal control. Here, I review the endocrine and genetic bases of a trade-off between parental and competitive behavior in an increasingly popular model of social behavior, the white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis). Within a population, approximately half of the individuals of this species exhibit a tan stripe (TS) on the crown and adopt a parental strategy, whereas the other half exhibit a white stripe (WS) and adopt a competitive strategy that manifests as increased territorial aggression and mate finding. We and others have shown evidence that the two morphs differ with respect to HPG function; for example, plasma levels of gonadal steroids differ between the morphs in both sexes. Comparing the morphs with regard to hormone levels gives only limited information about causal mechanisms, however, and preliminary behavioral studies in males suggest that morph differences in plasma androgens do not completely explain morph differences in territorial aggression. The polymorphism segregates with a structural rearrangement of chromosome 2 (ZAL2(m)), which offers a unique and powerful starting point on which to base a more targeted approach. An ongoing effort to characterize the ZAL2(m) arrangement using modern genomic techniques has revealed two included inversions that have captured a number of endocrine genes, linking them together as a potential "supergene". This finding is compelling in light of classic hypotheses regarding the evolution of alternative phenotypes, which predict the involvement of linked genes with pleiotropic and/or antagonistic effects that cause disruptive selection toward alternative optima. Similar predictions apply to the evolution of sex and sex chromosomes, which strongly resemble the ZAL2(m) system. Overall, the white-throated sparrow represents an ideal model in which to study the genetic and endocrine bases of life history strategies and their evolution.},

This is particularly evident in the trafficking and regulation of membrane proteins to and from synapses, which can be a long distance away from the cell body and number in the thousands. The regulation of neurotransmitter receptors, such as the AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs), the major excitatory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain, is a crucial mechanism for the modulation of synaptic transmission. The levels of AMPARs at synapses are very dynamic, and it is these plastic changes in synaptic function that are thought to underlie information storage in the brain. Thus, understanding the cellular machinery that controls AMPAR trafficking will be critical for understanding the cellular basis of behavior as well as many neurological diseases. Here we describe the life cycle of AMPARs, from their biogenesis, through their journey to the synapse, and ultimately through their demise, and discuss how the modulation of this process is essential for brain function.},

This delicate balance between neuronal output and distributed synaptic weight may be necessary for maintaining efficient encoding of information across neuronal networks. Here, we demonstrate that Arc/Arg3.1, an immediate-early gene (IEG) that is rapidly induced by neuronal activity associated with information encoding in the brain, mediates homeostatic synaptic scaling of AMPA type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) via its ability to activate a novel and selective AMPAR endocytic pathway. High levels of Arc/Arg3.1 block the homeostatic increases in AMPAR function induced by chronic neuronal inactivity. Conversely, loss of Arc/Arg3.1 results in increased AMPAR function and abolishes homeostatic scaling of AMPARs. These observations, together with evidence that Arc/Arg3.1 is required for memory consolidation, reveal the importance of Arc/Arg3.1's dynamic expression as it exerts continuous and precise control over synaptic strength and cellular excitability.},

  abstract = {Information is stored in neural circuits through long-lasting changes in synaptic strengths. Most studies of information storage have focused on mechanisms such as long-term potentiation and depression (LTP and LTD), in which synaptic strengths change in a synapse-specific manner. In contrast, little attention has been paid to mechanisms that regulate the total synaptic strength of a neuron. Here we describe a new form of synaptic plasticity that increases or decreases the strength of all of a neuron's synaptic inputs as a function of activity. Chronic blockade of cortical culture activity increased the amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) without changing their kinetics. Conversely, blocking GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)-mediated inhibition initially raised firing rates, but over a 48-hour period mESPC amplitudes decreased and firing rates returned to close to control values. These changes were at least partly due to postsynaptic alterations in the response to glutamate, and apparently affected each synapse in proportion to its initial strength. Such 'synaptic scaling' may help to ensure that firing rates do not become saturated during developmental changes in the number and strength of synaptic inputs, as well as stabilizing synaptic strengths during Hebbian modification and facilitating competition between synapses.},

A non-Hebbian form of synaptic plasticity, which scales synaptic strengths up or down to stabilize firing rates, has recently been discovered in cultured neuronal networks. Here we demonstrate the existence of a similar mechanism in the intact rodent visual cortex. The frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in principal neurons increased steeply between post-natal days 12 and 23. There was a concomitant decrease in mEPSC amplitude, which was prevented by rearing rats in complete darkness from 12 days of age. In addition, as little as two days of monocular deprivation scaled up mEPSC amplitude in a layer- and age-dependent manner. These data indicate that mEPSC amplitudes can be globally scaled up or down as a function of development and sensory experience, and suggest that synaptic scaling may be involved in the activity-dependent refinement of cortical connectivity.},

Most studies of long-term changes in synaptic strength have concentrated on Hebbian mechanisms, where these changes occur in a synapse-specific manner. While Hebbian mechanisms are important for modifying neuronal circuitry selectively, they might not be sufficient because they tend to destabilize the activity of neuronal networks. Recently, several forms of homeostatic plasticity that stabilize the properties of neural circuits have been identified. These include mechanisms that regulate neuronal excitability, stabilize total synaptic strength, and influence the rate and extent of synapse formation. These forms of homeostatic plasticity are likely to go 'hand-in-glove' with Hebbian mechanisms to allow experience to modify the properties of neuronal networks selectively.},

Arc is strongly induced by patterns of synaptic activity that also induce long-term potentiation, and Arc mRNA is then rapidly delivered into dendrites after episodes of neuronal activation. The newly synthesized Arc mRNA localizes selectively at synapses that recently have been activated, and the encoded protein is assembled into the synaptic junctional complex. The dynamics of trafficking of Arc mRNA reveal key features of the mechanism through which synaptic activity can both induce gene expression and target particular mRNA transcripts to the active synapses.},

The targeting of Arc mRNA was not disrupted by locally inhibiting protein synthesis, indicating that the signals for mRNA localization reside in the mRNA itself.

Here, we demonstrate that Arc/Arg3.1 protein interacts with dynamin and specific isoforms of endophilin to enhance receptor endocytosis. Arc/Arg3.1 selectively modulates trafficking of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) in neurons by accelerating endocytosis and reducing surface expression. The Arc/Arg3.1-endocytosis pathway appears to regulate basal AMPAR levels since Arc/Arg3.1 KO neurons exhibit markedly reduced endocytosis and increased steady-state surface levels. These findings reveal a novel molecular pathway that is regulated by Arc/Arg3.1 and likely contributes to late-phase synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation.},

Here, we demonstrate that Arc/Arg3.1 is translationally induced within 5 min of mGluR activation, and this response is essential for mGluR-dependent LTD. The increase in Arc/Arg3.1 translation requires eEF2K, a Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase that binds mGluR and dissociates upon mGluR activation, whereupon it phosphorylates eEF2. Phospho-eEF2 acts to slow the elongation step of translation and inhibits general protein synthesis but simultaneously increases Arc/Arg3.1 translation. Genetic deletion of eEF2K results in a selective deficit of rapid mGluR-dependent Arc/Arg3.1 translation and mGluR-LTD. This rapid translational mechanism is disrupted in the fragile X disease mouse (Fmr1 KO) in which mGluR-LTD does not require de novo protein synthesis but does require Arc/Arg3.1.

  abstract = {In a manner unique among activity-regulated immediate early genes (IEGs), mRNA encoded by Arc (also known as Arg3.1) undergoes rapid transport to dendrites and local synaptic translation. Despite this intrinsic appeal, relatively little is known about the neuronal and behavioral functions of Arc or its molecular mechanisms of action. Here, we attempt to distill recent advances on Arc spanning its transcriptional and translational regulation, the functions of the Arc protein in multiple forms of neuronal plasticity [long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD), and homeostatic plasticity], and its broader role in neural networks of behaving animals. Worley and colleagues have shown that Arc interacts with endophilin and dynamin, creating a postsynaptic trafficking endosome that selectively modifies the expression of AMPA-type glutamate receptors at the excitatory synapses. Both LTD and homeostatic plasticity in the hippocampus are critically dependent on Arc-mediated endocytosis of AMPA receptors. LTD evoked by activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors depends on rapid Arc translation controlled by elongation factor 2. Bramham and colleagues have shown that sustained translation of newly induced Arc mRNA is necessary for cofilin phosphorylation and stable expansion of the F-actin cytoskeleton underlying LTP consolidation in the dentate gyrus of live rats. In addition to regulating F-actin, Arc synthesis maintains the activity of key translation factors during LTP consolidation. This process of Arc-dependent consolidation is activated by the secretory neurotrophin, BDNF. Moore and colleagues have shown that Arc mRNA is a natural target for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) by virtue of its two conserved 3'-UTR introns. NMD and other related translation-dependent mRNA decay mechanisms may serve as critical brakes on protein expression that contribute to the fine spatial-temporal control of Arc synthesis. In studies in behaving rats, Guzowski and colleagues have shown that location-specific firing of CA3 and CA1 hippocampal neurons in the presence of theta rhythm provides the necessary stimuli for activation of Arc transcription. The impact of Arc transcription in memory processes may depend on the specific context of coexpressed IEGs, in addition to posttranscriptional regulation of Arc by neuromodulatory inputs from the amygdala and other brain regions. In sum, Arc is emerging as a versatile, finely tuned system capable of coupling changes in neuronal activity patterns to diverse forms of synaptic plasticity, thereby optimizing information storage in active networks.},

However, the roles of each striatal input pathway in these learning processes remain uncertain. We developed a novel strategy to target specific neural pathways and applied this strategy for studying behavioral roles of the pathway originating from the parafascicular nucleus (PF) and projecting to the dorsolateral striatum. A highly efficient retrograde gene transfer vector encoding the recombinant immunotoxin (IT) receptor was injected into the dorsolateral striatum in mice to express the receptor in neurons innervating the striatum. IT treatment into the PF of the vector-injected animals caused a selective elimination of neurons of the PF-derived thalamostriatal pathway. The elimination of this pathway impaired the response selection accuracy and delayed the motor response in the acquisition of a visual cue-dependent discrimination task. When the pathway elimination was induced after learning acquisition, it disturbed the response accuracy in the task performance with no apparent change in the response time. The elimination did not influence spontaneous locomotion, methamphetamine-induced hyperactivity, and motor skill learning that demand the function of the dorsal striatum. These results demonstrate that thalamostriatal projection derived from the PF plays essential roles in the acquisition and execution of discrimination learning in response to sensory stimulus. The temporal difference in the pathway requirement for visual discrimination suggests a stage-specific role of thalamostriatal pathway in the modulation of response time of learned motor actions.},

Twelve Golgi-impregnated spiny neurons were recovered and examined in the light and electron microscope after gold-toning. Ten of these neurons were typical very densely spiny medium-size neurons and they were all found to receive asymmetric synaptic input on dendritic spines from degenerating corticostriatal boutons. However, even though numerous boutons labelled anterogradely by HRP-WGA from the parafascicular nucleus were found within the dendritic fields of neurons that received cortical input, none of the terminals from the thalamus made synaptic contact with these neurons. Instead, all 96 thalamostriatal boutons studied were found in asymmetric synaptic contact with dendritic shafts of other neurons. Two such neurons that received input from the parafascicular nucleus were Golgi-impregnated and appeared to be medium-size spiny neurons, but they had a lower density of spines than the typical very densely spiny neurons. An independent confirmation that the targets of thalamostriatal neurons originating in the parafascicular nucleus are dendritic shafts was provided by studying the boutons labelled following electrolytic lesioning or injection of the lectin Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) into this nucleus: these boutons were also found to form asymmetric synaptic contacts with dendritic shafts within the neostriatum. It is concluded that although afferents from the somatosensory cortex and from the parafascicular nucleus converge upon the same part of the neostriatum, they probably do not converge upon the same spiny neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

In the male Syrian hamster, these signals are integrated in nuclei of the medial extended amygdala, where olfactory and vomeronasal system transmission is modulated by populations of androgen- and estrogen-sensitive neurons. Evidence from behavioral changes following lesions and from immediate early gene expression supports the hypothesis that the medial extended amygdala and medial preoptic area belong to a circuit that functions selectively in male sexual behavior. However, accumulated behavioral, neuroanatomical, and neuroendocrine data in hamsters, other rodents, and other mammals indicate that this circuit is embedded in a larger integrated network that controls not only male mating behavior, but female sexual behavior, parental behavior, and various forms of aggression. In this context, perhaps an individual animal's social responses can be more easily understood as a repertoire of closely interrelated, hormone-regulated behaviors, shaped by development and experience and modulated acutely by the environmental signals and the hormonal milieu of the brain.},

  abstract = {While a basal ganglia with striatal and pallidal subdivisions is 1 clearly present in many extant anamniote species, this basal ganglia is cell sparse and receives only a relatively modest tegmental dopaminergic input and little if any cortical input. The major basal ganglia influence on motor functions in anamniotes appears to be exerted via output circuits to the tectum. In contrast, in modern mammals, birds, and reptiles (i.e., modern amniotes), the striatal and pallidal parts of the basal ganglia are very neuron-rich, both consist of the same basic populations of neurons in all amniotes, and the striatum receives abundant tegmental dopaminergic and cortical input. The functional circuitry of the basal ganglia also seems very similar in all amniotes, since the major basal ganglia influences on motor functions appear to be exerted via output circuits to both cerebral cortex and tectum in sauropsids (i.e., birds and reptiles) and mammals. The basal ganglia, output circuits to the cortex, however, appear to be considerably more developed in mammals than in birds and reptiles. The basal ganglia, thus, appears to have undergone a major elaboration during the evolutionary transition from amphibians to reptiles. This elaboration may have enabled amniotes to learn and/or execute a more sophisticated repertoire of behaviors and movements, and this ability may have been an important element of the successful adaptation of amniotes to a fully terrestrial habitat. The mammalian lineage appears, however, to have diverged somewhat from the sauropsid lineage with respect to the emergence of the cerebral cortex as the major target of the basal ganglia circuitry devoted to executing the basal ganglia-mediated control of movement.},

  abstract = {Song learning in oscine birds relies on a circuit known as the "anterior forebrain pathway," which includes a specialized region of the avian basal ganglia. This region, area X, is embedded within a telencephalic structure considered homologous to the striatum, the input structure of the mammalian basal ganglia. Area X has many features in common with the mammalian striatum, yet has distinctive traits, including largely aspiny projection neurons that directly innervate the thalamus and a cell type that physiologically resembles neurons recorded in the mammalian globus pallidus. We have proposed that area X is a mixture of striatum and globus pallidus and has the same functional organization as circuits in the mammalian basal ganglia. Using electrophysiological and anatomical approaches, we found that area X contains a functional analog of the "direct" striatopallidothalamic pathway of mammals: axons of the striatal spiny neurons make close contacts on the somata and dendrites of pallidal cells. A subset of pallidal neurons project directly to the thalamus. Surprisingly, we found evidence that many pallidal cells may not project to the thalamus, but rather participate in a functional analog of the mammalian "indirect" pathway, which may oppose the effects of the direct pathway. Our results deepen our understanding of how information flows through area X and provide more support for the notion that song learning in oscines employs physiological mechanisms similar to basal ganglia-dependent forms of motor learning in mammals.},

  abstract = {Bird song learning has become a powerful model system for studying learning because of its parallels with human speech learning, recent advances in understanding of its neurobiological basis, and the strong tradition of studying song learning in both the laboratory and the field. Most of the findings and concepts in the field derive from the tape-tutor experimental paradigm, in which the young bird is tutored by tape-recorded song delivered by a loudspeaker in an isolation chamber. This paradigm provides rigorous experimental control of auditory parameters, but strips song learning of any social context, and has slowed the realization that social factors might be critical to the process. In recent years, field research and lab studies using live birds as tutors have revealed that social factors play a preeminent role in song learning. In this article, we propose a new experimental paradigm-the virtual-tutor design, which permits precise manipulation of singing interactions between simulated tutors that the young bird "overhears," as well as direct singing interactions between the young bird and the simulated tutors. We suggest that this approach may permit researchers to analyze social factors in bird song learning, particularly those relating to auditory interactions, that have been difficult to analyze heretofore.},

Here we review some of the processes that contribute to song learning and production, with an emphasis on the role of auditory feedback. We then consider some of the possible neural substrates involved in these processes, particularly basal ganglia circuitry. Although a thorough treatment of human speech is beyond the scope of this article, we point out similarities between speech and song learning, and ways in which studies of these disparate behaviours complement each other in developing an understanding of general principles that contribute to learning and maintenance of vocal behaviour.},

Both the cerebellum and the basal ganglia have highly conserved circuit architecture in vertebrates. The cerebellum has consistently been shown to be necessary for adaptation of eye and limb movements. The precise contribution of the basal ganglia to motor learning remains unclear but one consistent finding is that they are necessary for early acquisition of novel sequential actions. The primary motor cortex allows independent control of joints and construction of new movement synergies. We suggest that this capacity of the motor cortex implies that it is a necessary locus for motor skill learning, which we argue is the ability to execute selected actions with increasing speed and precision. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

The presumptive cholinergic neurons were labelled with antibodies directed against choline acetyltransferase and the afferent fibers were labelled anterogradely with Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin. Fibers from the subiculum of the hippocampal formation and from the midline and intralaminar thalamus project densely into the medial nucleus accumbens where they overlap a relatively dense population of choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive neurons. Varicosities containing Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin juxtapose the immunoreactive neurons. To study the possibility that the cholinergic neurons could be the synaptic targets of these incoming fibers, the subiculum, the fornix, and the midline/intralaminar thalamus were lesioned in separate animals and brain sections were immunoprocessed for choline acetyltransferase and studied with the electron microscope. In addition, dual-labelling electron microscopic immunocytochemistry was employed. In total, 164 synaptic terminals from the subiculum/hippocampus and 130 from the midline/intralaminar thalamus were examined; all formed asymmetrical synaptic specializations. No hippocampal endings were seen to contact the somata or primary dendrites of the choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive neurons; however, three were found in synaptic contact with distal, immunolabelled dendritic shafts. Most hippocampal terminals established contacts with unlabelled spines. Fifteen percent of the thalamic endings were found to synapse on the somata and the primary and distal dendrites of the choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive neurons. The remaining thalamic terminals established synaptic junctions with small unlabelled dendrites or spines. These findings have important implications not only for our understanding of the synaptic organization of the hippocampal and thalamic projections to the nucleus accumbens, but also for the contribution of the cholinergic neurons to the circuitry of this nucleus.},

However, the projection sites of striatal neurons contacted by thalamic afferents still remain to be determined. We therefore carried out an anatomical study aimed at elucidating the hodology of striatal neurones that receive input from the CM in squirrel monkeys. Our approach was to combine the anterograde transport of Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) or biocytin from the CM with the retrograde transport of biotinylated dextran-amine (bio-dex) or PHA-L from the internal (GPi) or external (GPe) segments of the globus pallidus. Following CM injections, rich plexuses of anterogradely labelled, thin varicose fibres aggregated in the form of bands that were confined to the postcommissural region of the putamen. On the other hand, injections into the GPe or GPi led to profuse retrograde labelling of a multitude of medium-sized spiny neurones. In cases where the injections involved the caudoventral two-thirds of the GPe or GPi, the retrogradely labelled striatopallidal cells and the anterogradely labelled thalamostriatal fibres occurred in the sensorimotor territory of the putamen. After injections into either pallidal segments, clusters of retrogradely labelled cells were in register with bands of anterogradely labelled thalamic fibres. However, electron microscopic analysis of striatal regions containing both anterogradely labelled thalamic afferents and retrogradely labelled cells revealed that terminals from the CM frequently form asymmetric synapses with dendritic shafts and spines of striato-GPi cells but rarely with those of striato-GPe cells. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that thalamic afferents from the CM innervate preferentially striatopallidal neurones projecting to the GPi in monkeys. These results indicate that the striatopallidal neurones contributing to the "direct" and "indirect" output pathways are differentially innervated by thalamic afferents in primates.},

  abstract = {Recent studies indicate that extrinsic inputs from sensorimotor regions of the cerebral cortex and the centromedian intralaminar thalamic nucleus terminate preferentially upon specific subpopulations of striatal output neurons in monkeys. The objective of the present study was to verify whether this specificity of innervation also characterizes the synaptic interactions between thalamic inputs from the centromedian nucleus and the four major populations of striatal interneurons. This was achieved by double labelling techniques at the electron microscope level, combining the anterograde transport of biotinylated-dextran amine with the immunostaining for specific markers of striatal interneurons (somatostatin, parvalbumin, choline acetyltransferase and calretinin). Injections of biotinylated-dextran amine in the centromedian nucleus led to dense bands of anterograde labelling which, in double immunostained sections, largely overlapped with the four populations of interneurons in the postcommissural region of the putamen. In the electron microscope, biotinylated-dextran amine-containing terminals formed asymmetric axo-dendritic synapses with somatostatin-, parvalbumin-, and choline acetyltransferase-containing elements. However, synapses between anterogradely labelled terminals and calretinin-positive neurons were not found. In sections processed to localize biotinylated-dextran amine and parralbumin or calretinin, double-labelled terminals (biotinylated-dextran amine/parvalbumin and biotinylated-dextran amine/calretinin), morphologically similar to thalamostriatal boutons, were found in the striatum indicating that calcium binding proteins may be expressed by thalamostriatal neurons. To test this possibility, we combined the retrograde transport of lectin- conjugated horseradish peroxidase from the putamen with parvalbumin and calretinin immunostaining and found that, indeed, most of the retrogradely labelled cells in the centromedian nucleus displayed parvalbumin and calretinin immunoreactivity. Moreover, co-localization studies revealed that calretinin and parralbumin co-exist in single neurons of the centromedian nucleus. In conclusion, striatal interneurons immunoreactive for somatostatin, parvalbumin and choline acetyltransferase, but not those containing calretinin, receive strong inputs from the centromedian nucleus in monkeys. Moreover, our findings indicate that parvalbumin and calretinin co- exist in individual thalamostriatal neurons. In combination with our previous data, these results suggest that thalamic information may be conveyed to striatal projection neurons both, directly via excitatory synaptic inputs, or indirectly via striatal interneurons. The relative importance of those direct and indirect thalamic influences upon the activity of striatal output neurons remains to be established.},

Neurol. 140:35-52, '70) have described an ascending tectofugal visual pathway from the optic tectum to the ectostriatum by way of the nucleus rotundus of the thalamus. This present study used anterograde autoradiographic and retrograde horseradish peroxidase pathway-tracing techniques to investigate another ascending tectofugal pathway in the pigeon. Injections of 3H-proline/leucine confirmed a previous report that the optic tectum projects to the nucleus dorsolateralis posterior of the thalamus (DLP). This projection is predominantly ipsilateral and is confined to a large-celled caudal region of the nucleus (DLPc); the rostral region of the nucleus (DLPr) is not tectorecipient. Injections of horseradish peroxidase in DLPc labeled cells predominantly ipsilaterally in layers 8-15 of the optic tectum. Injections of 3H-proline/leucine placed in the DLPc labeled a discrete region of the ipsilateral telencephalon. Similar injections of DLPr labeled a contiguous, but more rostral, region of the neostriatum intermedium. Nissl- and silver-stained material indicated that the region in which DLP terminates is cytoarchitecturally distinct from ventromedial ectostriatal core and belt. Injections of horseradish peroxidase at various locations in the neostriatal DLP terminal field demonstrated a rostrocaudal ordering of the DLP projection upon the neostriatum intermedium. Single-unit recording demonstrated that cells in DLPc respond to whole-field illumination at the same latency as cells in the nucleus rotundus, indicating that the tecto-DLPc-neostriatal pathway transmits visual information to the telencephalon. We suggest that comparable pathways may exist in both reptiles and mammals.},

  abstract = {The song system of oscine birds has frequently been presented as a model system for motor learning in vertebrates. This practice has been bolstered by the growing recognition that one part of the song system that is essential for song learning, area X, is a component of the avian striatum. The mammalian striatum, the input structure of the basal ganglia, has been implicated in a number of motor-related functions, including motor learning, suggesting that song learning in birds and motor learning in mammals may use similar physiological mechanisms. We studied the intrinsic physiological properties of area X neurons in brain slices to see how closely they match properties identified in mammalian striatal neurons and to collect data that are necessary to understand how area X processes information. We found that area X contains all four physiological cell types present in the mammalian striatum and that each is very similar to its mammalian counterpart. We also found a fifth cell type in area X that has not been reported in mammalian striatum; instead, this cell type resembles neurons that have been recorded in the mammalian globus pallidus. This pallidum-like cell type morphologically resembles the projection neurons of area X. We suggest that area X contains a pathway equivalent to the "direct" striatopallidothalamic pathway through the mammalian basal ganglia, with the striatal and pallidal components intermingled in one nucleus.

Brain pathways for vocal learning have been studied in the three bird groups and in humans. Here I present a hypothesis on the relationships and evolution of brain pathways for vocal learning among birds and humans. The three vocal learning bird groups each appear to have seven similar but not identical cerebral vocal nuclei distributed into two vocal pathways, one posterior and one anterior. Humans also appear to have a posterior vocal pathway, which includes projections from the face motor cortex to brainstem vocal lower motor neurons, and an anterior vocal pathway, which includes a strip of premotor cortex, the anterior basal ganglia, and the anterior thalamus. These vocal pathways are not found in vocal non-learning birds or mammals, but are similar to brain pathways used for other types of learning. Thus, I argue that if vocal learning evolved independently among birds and humans, then it did so under strong genetic constraints of a pre-existing basic neural network of the vertebrate brain.},

A total of 29 axons connected to their parent cell body were entirely reconstructed from serial sections with a camera lucida. Our investigation shows that the CM and Pf nuclei in primates comprise three types of projection neurons: (1) neurons that innervate densely and focally the striatum; (2) neurons that arborize diffusely in the cerebral cortex; and (3) neurons that innervate both striatum and cerebral cortex. Striatal innervation of CM origin consists of dense clusters of axon terminals exhibiting pedunculated varicosities and forming oblique bands in the dorsolateral sector of putamen (sensorimotor striatal territory). The same type of striatal innervation occurs in the head of caudate nucleus (associative striatal territory) in cases of Pf-labeled neurons. The CM neurons that target cerebral cortex arborize principally in motor and premotor areas, whereas Pf neurons innervate chiefly prefrontal areas. Cortical innervation from both nuclei is much more profuse in layers V and VI than in layer I. Our three-dimensional reconstruction studies show that dendritic and axonal arborizations of CM neurons extend essentially along the sagittal plane. These results revealed that, in contrast to rodents where virtually all Pf neurons project to both striatum and cortex, the primate CM/Pf complex harbors several types of highly patterned projection neurons. As such, this complex might be considered as an integral part of the widely distributed basal ganglia neuronal system.},

  abstract = {Because of our limited knowledge of the functional role of the thalamostriatal system, this massive network is often ignored in models of the pathophysiology of brain disorders of basal ganglia origin, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). However, over the past decade, significant advances have led to a deeper understanding of the anatomical, electrophysiological, behavioral and pathological aspects of the thalamostriatal system. The cloning of the vesicular glutamate transporters 1 and 2 (vGluT1 and vGluT2) has provided powerful tools to differentiate thalamostriatal from corticostriatal glutamatergic terminals, allowing us to carry out comparative studies of the synaptology and plasticity of these two systems in normal and pathological conditions. Findings from these studies have led to the recognition of two thalamostriatal systems, based on their differential origin from the caudal intralaminar nuclear group, the center median/parafascicular (CM/Pf) complex, or other thalamic nuclei. The recent use of optogenetic methods supports this model of the organization of the thalamostriatal systems, showing differences in functionality and glutamate receptor localization at thalamostriatal synapses from Pf and other thalamic nuclei. At the functional level, evidence largely gathered from thalamic recordings in awake monkeys strongly suggests that the thalamostriatal system from the CM/Pf is involved in regulating alertness and switching behaviors. Importantly, there is evidence that the caudal intralaminar nuclei and their axonal projections to the striatum partly degenerate in PD and that CM/Pf deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be therapeutically useful in several movement disorders.},

  abstract = {The lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum (lMAN) is necessary for both initial learning of vocal patterns in developing zebra finches, as well as for modification of adult song under some circumstances. Lateral MAN is composed of two subregions: a core of magnocellular neurons and a surrounding shell composed primarily of parvocellular neurons. Neurons in lMAN(core) project to a region of motor cortex known as robust nucleus of the archistriatum (RA), whereas neurons in lMAN(shell) project to a region adjacent to RA known as dorsal archistriatum (Ad). We studied the axonal connections of Ad in adult male zebra finches. In contrast to RA, Ad neurons make a large number of efferent projections, which do not include direct inputs to vocal or respiratory motor neurons. The major efferent projections of Ad are to: (1) the striatum of avian basal ganglia; (2) a dorsal thalamic zone (including the song-control nuclei dorsomedial nucleus of the posterior thalamus [DMP] and dorsolateral nucleus of the medial thalamus [DLM]); (3) restricted regions within the lateral hypothalamus (stratum cellulare externum [SCE]), which may also relay information to the same dorsal thalamic zone; (4) a nucleus in the caudal thalamus (medial spiriform nucleus [SpM]); (5) deep layers of the tectum, which project to the thalamic song-control nucleus Uva; (6) broad regions of pontine and midbrain reticular formation; and (7) areas within the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra (ventral tegmental area [AVT], substantia nigra [SN]), which overlap with regions that project to Area X, a song-control nucleus of avian striatum. Inputs to Ad derive not only from lMAN(shell), but also from a large area of dorsolateral caudal neostriatum (dNCL), which also receives input from lMAN(shell). That is, lMAN(shell) neurons project directly to Ad, and also multisynaptically to Ad via dNCL. Double-labeling studies show that lMAN(shell) contains two different populations of projection neurons: one that projects to Ad and another to dNCL. These results are exciting for two main reasons. The first is that some of these projections represent potential closed-loop circuits that could relay information back to song-control nuclei of the telencephalon, possibly allowing diverse types of song-related information to be both integrated between loops and compared during the period of auditory-motor integration. Because both auditory experience with an adult (tutor) song pattern and auditory feedback are essential to vocal learning, closed-loop pathways could serve as comparator circuits in which efferent commands, auditory feedback, and the memory of the tutor song are compared in an iterative fashion to achieve a gradual refinement of vocal production until it matches the tutor song. In addition, these circuits seem to have a strong integrative and limbic flavor. That is, the axonal connections of Ad neurons clearly include regions that receive inputs not only from somatosensory, visual, and auditory areas of cortex, but also from limbic regions, suggesting that they may be involved in higher order sensory processing, arousal, and motivation.},

To obtain new information about the possible function of the DLM--{$>$}lMAN--{$>$}RA pathway in vocal learning, we used anterograde and retrograde tract-tracing techniques (pressure injections of DiI and DiA) to map the pattern of axonal connections between these brain regions in adult male zebra finches. Results revealed two topographically organized pathways that traverse the songbird forebrain in parallel. An oval-shaped dorsal/lateral portion of DLM projects solely to the central core of lMAN (lMANcore), whereas a crescent-shaped region, including ventral and medial DLM, projects exclusively to a parvicellular shell that encircles lMANcore (lMANshell). In turn, lMANshell neurons project solely to an arc-shaped region of dorsal archistriatum just lateral to RA (Ad; archistriatum, pars dorsalis), whereas lMANcore neurons project exclusively to RA. We also identified crossed and reciprocal pathways between lMANcore/shell and the lateral portion of the ventral archistriatum, which may contribute to interhemispheric coordination of vocal behavior. A robust topographic organization was observed in the axonal projections from dorsal/lateral-DLM--{$>$}lMANcore--{$>$}RA and from ventral/medial-DLM--{$>$}lMANshell--{$>$}Ad, raising the question of what is being mapped within these two forebrain pathways. Because RA projection neurons are organized myotopically with respect to the major vocal (syringeal) muscles (D.S. Vicario, 1991, J. Comp. Neurol. 309:486-494), one possibility is that a mapping of vocal/expiratory musculature is preserved "upstream" within these pathways. Similarly, the presence of song-selective auditory neurons in DLM, lMAN, and RA (A.J. Doupe and M. Konishi, 1991, Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 18:527) suggests that these pathways might subserve some form of auditory or auditory-motor mapping.},

  abstract = {Ever since Adam Smith, the central teaching of economics has been that free markets provide us with material well-being, as if by an invisible hand. In Phishing for Phools, Nobel Prize\textendash{}winning economists George Akerlof and Robert Shiller deliver a fundamental challenge to this insight, arguing that markets harm as well as help us. As long as there is profit to be made, sellers will systematically exploit our psychological weaknesses and our ignorance through manipulation and deception. Rather than being essentially benign and always creating the greater good, markets are inherently filled with tricks and traps and will "phish" us as "phools." Phishing for Phools therefore strikes a radically new direction in economics, based on the intuitive idea that markets both give and take away. Akerlof and Shiller bring this idea to life through dozens of stories that show how phishing affects everyone, in almost every walk of life. We spend our money up to the limit, and then worry about how to pay the next month's bills. The financial system soars, then crashes. We are attracted, more than we know, by advertising. Our political system is distorted by money. We pay too much for gym memberships, cars, houses, and credit cards. Drug companies ingeniously market pharmaceuticals that do us little good, and sometimes are downright dangerous. Phishing for Phools explores the central role of manipulation and deception in fascinating detail in each of these areas and many more. It thereby explains a paradox: why, at a time when we are better off than ever before in history, all too many of us are leading lives of quiet desperation. At the same time, the book tells stories of individuals who have stood against economic trickery\textemdash{}and how it can be reduced through greater knowledge, reform, and regulation.},

Here we review evidence for these similarities, including electrophysiological, morphological, and neurochemical data for identifying specific cell types. In addition, we discuss connectional data, addressing similarities in axonal projections among nuclei across taxa. We focus primarily on the anterior forebrain pathway, a circuit essential for song learning and vocal plasticity, because the evidence is strongest that this circuit is homologous to mammalian circuits. These fundamental similarities highlight the importance of comparative approaches; for example, understanding the role the anterior forebrain pathway plays in song plasticity may shed light on general principles of basal ganglia function. In addition, understanding specializations of such circuits in songbirds may illuminate specific innovations critical for vocal learning.},

Techniques were developed for inducing the rapid onset of song imitation in young zebra finches and for tracking trajectories of vocal change over a 7-week period until a match to a model song was achieved. Exposure to a model song induced the prompt generation of repeated structured sounds (prototypes) followed by a slow transition from repetitive to serial delivery of syllables. Tracking this transition revealed two phenomena: (i) Imitations of dissimilar sounds can emerge from successive renditions of the same prototype, and (ii) developmental trajectories for some sounds followed paths of increasing acoustic mismatch until an abrupt correction occurred by period doubling. These dynamics are likely to reflect underlying neural and articulatory constraints on the production and imitation of sounds.},

  abstract = {In mammals, the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a glutamatergic diencephalic cell group that develops in the caudal hypothalamus and migrates to a position above the cerebral peduncle. By its input from the external pallidal segment and projection to the internal pallidal segment, STN plays a critical role in basal ganglia functions. Although the basal ganglia in birds is well developed, possesses the same major neuron types as in mammals, and plays a role in movement control similar to that in mammals, it has been uncertain whether birds possess an STN. We report here evidence indicating that the so-called anterior nucleus of the ansa lenticularis (ALa) is the avian homolog of mammalian STN. First, the avian ALa too develops within the mammillary hypothalamic area and migrates to a position adjacent to the cerebral peduncle. Second, ALa specifically receives input from dorsal pallidal neurons that receive input from enkephalinergic striatal neurons, as is true of STN. Third, ALa projects back to avian dorsal pallidum, as also the case for STN in mammals. Fourth, the neurons of ALa contain glutamate, and the target neurons of ALa in dorsal pallidum possess AMPA-type glutamate receptor profiles resembling those of mammalian pallidal neurons. Fifth, unilateral lesions of ALa yield behavioral disturbances and movement asymmetries resembling those observed in mammals after STN lesions. These various findings indicate that ALa is the avian STN, and they suggest that the output circuitry of the basal ganglia for motor control is similar in birds and mammals.},

Lesions of this pathway in juvenile birds disrupt vocal development, whereas identical lesions in adult birds do not influence the production of already learned song. During the course of vocal learning, IMAN undergoes a phase of massive neuronal loss, whereas the neuronal population of X more than doubles. In the present study, the development of neuron number in DLM was analyzed and found not to change during the course of vocal learning. Anterograde DiI labeling of DLM efferent fibers was then used to analyze the morphological development of this projection in relation to both the loss of neurons from lMAN and the loss of the ability of X-DLM-lMAN lesions to influence vocal production. We found that DLM axons arrive within lMAN by 15 days of age, prior to both the loss of neurons from lMAN and the onset of vocal production. The volume of anterograde DiI label over lMAN did not change between 15 and 20 days of age, but this volume more than doubled between 20 and 35 days of age. During this phase of exuberant growth, anterograde label matched the dorsal border of lMAN but extended beyond all other borders of lMAN into a surrounding "shell" of parvicellular neurons.},

  abstract = {Anatomical and neurophysiological studies have established that Area X, a songbird nucleus essential for vocal learning, is a basal ganglia structure, with mammalian striatal properties. However, Area X also sends a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic projection to the medial portion of the dorsolateral thalamus (DLM), a projection characteristic of the pallidum. These findings suggested that Area X contains both striatal and pallidal neurons. To test this hypothesis further, we investigated the neurochemistry and connectivity of Area X and its projections by using neurotransmitter antibodies, in combination with tracing studies. Like the mammalian striatum, Area X contains small enkephalin- and substance P-immunopositive neurons. Choline acetyltransferase-positive cells of Area X do not retrogradely label from DLM and are probably cholinergic interneurons similar to those in mammals. Like pallidal cells, large GABAergic cells project from Area X to the thalamus, but they also contain enkephalin, a characteristic of striatal neurons projecting to indirect pathway pallidal neurons. Moreover, many Area X cells are labeled with the pallidal marker Nkx2.1, but these do not include any thalamus-projecting neurons, suggesting that the projection cells are not of pallidal embryonic origin. Thus, although Area X combines both striatal and pallidal features, it is not a simple recapitulation of the mammalian circuit or of the avian lateral striatopallidal pathway: some individual Area X neurons may function as pallidal-like projection neurons but have striatal characteristics as well. Such heterogeneity of basal ganglia circuitry, both within and across species, may be facilitated by the developmental history of basal ganglia, which involves extensive migration and cellular intermixing.},

It receives cortical song-related input and projects to the dorsolateral medial nucleus of thalamus (DLM). We carried out single- and double-labeled immunohistochemical and pathway tracing studies in male zebra finch to characterize the cellular organization and circuitry of area X. We found that 5.4\% of area X neuronal perikarya are relatively large, possess aspiny dendrites, and are rich in the pallidal neuron/striatal interneuron marker Lys8-Asn9-neurotensin8-13 (LANT6). Many of these perikarya were found to project to the DLM, and their traits suggest that they are pallidal. Area X also contained several neuron types characteristic of the striatum, including interneurons co-containing LANT6 and the striatal interneuron marker parvalbumin (2\% of area X neurons), interneurons containing parvalbumin but not LANT6 (4.8\%), cholinergic interneurons (1.4\%), and neurons containing the striatal spiny projection neuron marker dopamine- and adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-regulated phosphoprotein (DARPP-32) (30\%). Area X was rich in substance P (SP)-containing terminals, and many ended on area X neurons projecting to the DLM with the woolly fiber morphology characteristic of striatopallidal terminals. Although SP+ perikarya were not detected in area X, prior studies suggest it is likely that SP-synthesizing neurons are present and the source of the SP+ input to area X neurons projecting to the DLM. Area X was poor in enkephalinergic fibers and perikarya. The present data support the premise that area X contains both striatal and pallidal neurons, with the striatal neurons likely to include SP+ neurons that project to the pallidal neurons.},

  abstract = {Dopamine has been implicated in mediating contextual modulation of motor behaviors and learning in many species. In songbirds, dopamine may act on the basal ganglia nucleus Area X to influence the neural activity that contributes to vocal learning and contextual changes in song variability. Neurons in midbrain dopamine centers, the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA), densely innervate Area X and show singing-related changes in firing rate. In addition, dopamine levels in Area X change during singing. It is unknown, however, how song-related information could reach dopaminergic neurons. Here we report an anatomical pathway that could provide song-related information to the SNc and VTA. By using injections of bidirectionally transported fluorescent tracers in adult male zebra finches, we show that Area X and other song control nuclei do not project directly to the SNc or VTA. Instead, we describe an indirect pathway from Area X to midbrain dopaminergic neurons via a connection in the ventral pallidum (VP). Specifically, Area X projects to the VP via axon collaterals of Area X output neurons that also project to the thalamus. Dual injections revealed that the area of VP receiving input from Area X projects to the SNc and VTA. Furthermore, VP terminals in the SNc and VTA overlap with cells that project back to Area X. A portion of the arcopallium also projects to the SNc and VTA and could carry auditory information. These data demonstrate an anatomical loop through which Area X activity could influence its dopaminergic input.},

The rich behavioral plasticity exhibited by songbirds, however, contrasts starkly with the scarcity of candidate cellular mechanisms. Here, we report for the first time on an activity-dependent form of synaptic plasticity in area X, a component of the song system required for song learning and song maintenance. In slice preparations of zebra finch area X, pairing of high-frequency presynaptic stimulation with postsynaptic depolarization induces Hebbian long-term potentiation (LTP) of the glutamatergic inputs to spiny neurons. This form of LTP requires activation of NMDA receptors and D1-like dopamine receptors. In addition, LTP is observed in birds as young as 47 d after hatching and also in adult birds but not in younger birds, providing evidence of developmental regulation of the onset of synaptic plasticity. These properties make this form of LTP the best known candidate mechanism for reinforcement-based vocal learning in juveniles and song maintenance in adult birds.},

  abstract = {Vocal behavior in songbirds exemplifies a rich integration of motor, cognitive, and social functions that are shared among vertebrates. As a part of the underlying neural substrate, the song system, the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP) is required for song learning and maintenance. The AFP resembles the mammalian basal ganglia-thalamocortical loop in its macroscopic organization, neuronal intrinsic properties, and microcircuitry. Area X, the first station in the AFP, is a part of the basal ganglia essential for vocal learning. It receives glutamatergic inputs from pallial structures and sends GABAergic outputs to thalamic structures. It also receives dense dopaminergic innervation from the midbrain. The role of this innervation is essentially unknown. Here we provide evidence that dopamine (DA) can modulate the glutamatergic inputs to spiny neurons in area X. In whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from neurons in brain slices of adult zebra finches, we found that activation of D1-like DA receptors depresses ionotropic glutamatergic synaptic current in area X spiny neurons. This effect is mediated by a presynaptic site of action, mimicked by activation of adenylyl cyclase, and blocked by protein kinase A inhibitor and an adenosine A1 receptor antagonist. These results suggest that, in addition to altering the input-output function of spiny neurons by modulating their excitability, as we have shown previously, DA can directly influence the excitatory inputs to these neurons as well. Thus, DA can exert fine control over information processing through spiny neurons in area X, the dynamics of the AFP output, and ultimately song learning and maintenance.},

  abstract = {The neural substrate of vocal learning in songbirds is an accessible system for studying motor learning and motor control in vertebrates. In the so-called song system, the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP), which is essential for song learning, resembles the mammalian basal ganglia-thalamocortical loop in its macroscopic organization, neuronal intrinsic properties, and microcircuitry. Area X, the first station in the AFP, and the surrounding lobus parolfactorius (LPO), are both parts of the avian basal ganglia. Like their mammalian counterparts, they receive dense dopaminergic innervation from the midbrain, but the physiological functions of this projection remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of dopamine (DA) on excitability of spiny neurons in area X and LPO. We recorded from neurons in brain slices of adult zebra finches and Bengalese finches, using whole-cell and perforated-patch recording techniques in current-clamp configuration. We found that DA modulates excitability in spiny neurons; activation of D1- and D2-like DA receptors enhances and reduces excitability, respectively. These effects are similar to those observed in the mammalian neostriatum, with the main difference being that D1-like DA receptor activation enhances excitability in avian spiny neurons at hyperpolarized states. Our findings also indicate that some spiny neurons express both receptor types and suggest that receptor colocalization in the entire population can account for the spectrum of DA actions. The diversity of DA actions enables the DA system to fine-tune the dynamics of the song system and allows flexible control over song learning and production.},

While a number of previous studies have shown afferents and efferents of the presumptive "nucleus accumbens," detailed and accurate connection patterns of this newly recognized area are still lacking. We set out to clarify these connections using small, localized injections of cholera toxin subunit B and biotinylated dextran amine directly into the nucleus. In order to increase the accuracy of tracer injections into target sites, we first conducted a systematic comparison of three calcium-binding proteins, namely, parvalbumin, calretinin, and calbindin, to characterize the nucleus accumbens and ascertain its boundaries. The results showed that the avian and mammalian nucleus accumbens had remarkable hodological similarities, including the connections with the hippocampus, amygdala, ventral pallidum, lateral hypothalamus, and ventral tegmental area. However, the most significant aspect of the present study is that the avian nucleus accumbens had extensive reciprocal connections with medial pallial structures, the mammalian counterparts of which are unclear. Three implications of this finding are discussed. First, the avian medial pallium may correspond to part of the mammalian prefrontal cortex based on the connections with the nucleus accumbens. Second, the avian brain has a "limbic loop" involving the medial pallium, which also receives input from the avian equivalent of the mediodorsal thalamus. Third, the extensive connections between the accumbens and medial pallium just dorsal to it suggest a column-like organization of limbic-associated areas in the avian telencephalon.},

It receives cortical song-related input and projects to the dorsolateral medial nucleus of thalamus (DLM). We carried out single- and double-labeled immunohistochemical and pathway tracing studies in male zebra finch to characterize the cellular organization and circuitry of area X. We found that 5.4\% of area X neuronal perikarya are relatively large, possess aspiny dendrites, and are rich in the pallidal neuron/striatal interneuron marker Lys8-Asn9-neurotensin8-13 (LANT6). Many of these perikarya were found to project to the DLM, and their traits suggest that they are pallidal. Area X also contained several neuron types characteristic of the striatum, including interneurons co-containing LANT6 and the striatal interneuron marker parvalbumin (2\% of area X neurons), interneurons containing parvalbumin but not LANT6 (4.8\%), cholinergic interneurons (1.4\%), and neurons containing the striatal spiny projection neuron marker dopamine- and adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-regulated phosphoprotein (DARPP-32) (30\%). Area X was rich in substance P (SP)-containing terminals, and many ended on area X neurons projecting to the DLM with the woolly fiber morphology characteristic of striatopallidal terminals. Although SP+ perikarya were not detected in area X, prior studies suggest it is likely that SP-synthesizing neurons are present and the source of the SP+ input to area X neurons projecting to the DLM. Area X was poor in enkephalinergic fibers and perikarya. The present data support the premise that area X contains both striatal and pallidal neurons, with the striatal neurons likely to include SP+ neurons that project to the pallidal neurons.},

  abstract = {Anatomical and neurophysiological studies have established that Area X, a songbird nucleus essential for vocal learning, is a basal ganglia structure, with mammalian striatal properties. However, Area X also sends a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic projection to the medial portion of the dorsolateral thalamus (DLM), a projection characteristic of the pallidum. These findings suggested that Area X contains both striatal and pallidal neurons. To test this hypothesis further, we investigated the neurochemistry and connectivity of Area X and its projections by using neurotransmitter antibodies, in combination with tracing studies. Like the mammalian striatum, Area X contains small enkephalin- and substance P-immunopositive neurons. Choline acetyltransferase-positive cells of Area X do not retrogradely label from DLM and are probably cholinergic interneurons similar to those in mammals. Like pallidal cells, large GABAergic cells project from Area X to the thalamus, but they also contain enkephalin, a characteristic of striatal neurons projecting to indirect pathway pallidal neurons. Moreover, many Area X cells are labeled with the pallidal marker Nkx2.1, but these do not include any thalamus-projecting neurons, suggesting that the projection cells are not of pallidal embryonic origin. Thus, although Area X combines both striatal and pallidal features, it is not a simple recapitulation of the mammalian circuit or of the avian lateral striatopallidal pathway: some individual Area X neurons may function as pallidal-like projection neurons but have striatal characteristics as well. Such heterogeneity of basal ganglia circuitry, both within and across species, may be facilitated by the developmental history of basal ganglia, which involves extensive migration and cellular intermixing.},

In order to determine these, a series retrograde and anterograde tracing experiments was carried out, largely with cholera toxin B-chain conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The results show that a sparse and diffuse projection to the red nucleus arises from deep regions of the hyperstriatum accessorium (HA) of the anterior Wulst, and that a much more dense projection arises from the caudal part of the nucleus principalis precommissuralis and the medial part of the medial spiriform nucleus (SpMm). These last two sources were themselves shown to receive a substantial projection from HA of the anterior Wulst. The red nucleus was also shown to project upon the cerebellar cortex of lobule VI, and SpM upon the cerebellar cortex of lobules VI through IX (Karten and Finger, Brain Res., 102:335-338, 1976; Clarke, J.

  abstract = {In the present study, we investigated whether a dorsal thalamic region comparable to the motor part of the mammalian ventral tier (the ventral anterior nucleus, the ventral lateral nucleus, and the oral ventroposterolateral nucleus) exists in pigeon. With this aim, we reinvestigated the projections of the pigeon dorsal pallidum to the dorsal thalamus by using 1) injections of the anterogradely transported form of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA; 10,000 molecular weight) in the pigeon dorsal pallidum (paleostriatum primitivum) and 2) injections of the retrogradely transported form of BDA (3,000 molecular weight) in the pigeon dorsal thalamus. Our results indicate that the dorsal pallidum in pigeons projects to three areas of the dorsal thalamus: the dorsointermediate posterior nucleus, the ventrointermediate area, and the nucleus subrotundus. Only the projection to the dorsointermediate posterior nucleus was described previously (Karten and Dubbeldam [1973] J. Comp. Neurol. 148:61-90; Kitt and Brauth [1982] Neuroscience 6:1551-1566). To investigate whether any of the dorsal thalamic nuclei receiving pallidal input project to a motor cortical field, injections of the retrograde tracer Fluoro-Gold were placed into the rostral Wulst. This is an avian cortical field that appears to contain a region comparable to mammalian primary somatomotor cortex (Karten [1971] Anat. Rec. 169:353; Wild [1992] J. Comp. Neurol. 287:1-18). Our results indicate that neurons in the rostral ventrointermediate area, but not in the nucleus subrotundus, the dorsointermediate posterior nucleus, or the intermediate or caudal parts of the ventrointermediate area, project to the rostral Wulst. In addition to the input from the dorsal pallidum, the avian ventrointermediate area also receives input from the lateral substantia nigra and the lateral and internal cerebellar nuclei (present results). Our results suggest the existence in birds of a pallidothalamocortical loop similar to the pallidoventral tier-motor cortex loop of mammals and suggest that the avian ventrointermediate area is comparable to the motor part of the mammalian ventral tier in both location and connections. If this is confirmed by physiological experiments, then it would indicate that basal ganglia control of movement mediated by a pallidothalamocortical loop may have evolved with the stem reptiles.},

In this paper, the bulbar premotor systems for jaw and tongue movements, head and neck movements, locomotion, and respiration and vocalization in birds are reviewed and compared to premotor systems in mammals. Roughly, the bulbar reticular formation can be subdivided in three longitudinal zones: a dorsolateral (RPcdl) and a ventromedial (RPcvm) parvocellular zone and a gigantocellular zone (RGc). RPcdl contains premotor neurons for the jaw and neck system, RPcvm for the jaw, tongue and neck system, and RGc for the tongue and locomotory system. RPcdl receives input from the descending sensory trigeminal system, parts of RPcvm and RGc from vestibular nuclei, whereas the tectum has a projection to the contralateral RGc. RPcdl and RPcvm receive substantial telencephalic input through the occipitomesencephalic tract. The bulbar part of the respiratory system consists of a series of cell groups in the ventrolateral reticular formation and has connections with motor centers of the vocalization system. The similarities and differences between the avian and mammalian situation are discussed. Musculomotor systems participate in various activities. It is argued that a premotor system should possess sufficient flexibility to control the participation of a motor system in the different activities. This flexibility may permit the occurrence of learning processes in terms of refining basically existing motor patterns. The emergence of new and more complex motor patterns as in vocalization requires the involvement of hierarchically higher brain centers.},

The present results show that neurons of nucleus dorsointermedius posterior project upon a crescent-shaped neuronal field within the neostriatum intermedium as well as upon the ventral paleostriatum and nucleus intrapeduncularis. The relationship of the neostriatum intermedium field to avian motor pathways is discussed and it is suggested that nucleus dorsointermedius posterior thalami of birds may play a role comparable to that of the mammalian ventral tier nuclei in the neural control of motor functions. The efferent projections of dorsointermedius posterior were contrasted with those of adjacent structures within the avian posterior thalamic complex. Neurons within nucleus dorsomedialis posterior appear to be related to the avian limbic system and project to a neuronal field within the rostromedial portion of the neostriatum intermedium. Neurons in nucleus dorsolateralis posterior have been shown to receive input from the optic tectum; efferents from dorsolateralis posterior were traced to a small triangular wedged-shaped field within the ventromedial portion of the periectostriatal belt.},

  abstract = {The organization of the cerebellum is characterized by a number of parallel and parasagittally ordered olivocorticonuclear modules; as such, the cerebellar nuclei basically function as output system of these modules. The present study provides a comprehensive and detailed description of the organization of the connections from the cerebellar nuclei to the brain stem in the rat. Thirteen small injections with the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin or biotinylated dextran amine which were centered on various aspects of the cerebellar nuclear complex are described and are illustrated with serial plots detailing the distribution of labeled varicosities throughout the brain stem. In every case at least 1,000 an up to 36,000 varicosities were plotted. All injections resulted in some or heavy labeling concentrated within specific regions of the contralateral inferior olivary complex and, usually, in some labeling of the contralateral ventrolateral thalamus. However, apart from these two areas it is shown that the cerebellar projections are generally very widespread and may be found throughout the entire brain stem. Below, only a survey of main projection areas will be given. Terminal arborizations originating from the rostral part of the medial cerebellar nucleus are mostly found in the caudal half of the brain stem with emphasis on the vestibular nuclear complex, whereas its caudal part rather connects to midbrain areas. Terminals that originate from the dorsolateral protuberance of the medial cerebellar nucleus are distributed more evenly throughout the brain stem and are mostly confined to reticular areas. The interstitial cell groups, interspersed between the medial and both interposed cerebellar nuclei, provide major projections to the ipsilateral vestibular nuclear complex and contralateral mesodiencephalic regions. However, reticular areas are also targeted over a large rostrocaudal range. The medial part of the posterior interposed nucleus sends most projections to the caudomedial red nucleus, prerubral regions and parvicellular reticular formation, all contralateral to the injection site. Projections that originate from more laterally placed injections are directed, apart from the inferior olivary complex, to the rostral half of the contralateral brain stem, where most labeled varicosities are found in the superior colliculus and zona incerta. The anterior interposed nucleus specifically targets the inferior olive, the red nucleus, the pontine reticulotegmental nucleus, the prectectum and the ventrolateral thalamic nucleus. More laterally placed injections also project to the ipsilateral parvicellular reticular formation and deep layers of the spinal trigeminal complex. The latter areas are more specifically targeted by the dorsolateral hump. In addition, its projections are found in the red nucleus and pretectum but do not seem to reach the ventrolateral thalamus. Projections from the lateral cerebellar nucleus are all characterized by a widespread distribution of terminals. Especially, the caudal aspect of the nucleus sends, apart from projections to the deep mesencephalic nucleus, red nucleus, periaquaductal gray, pretectum, prerubral area, and several thalamic regions, prominent projections to the caudal brain stem which terminate in the inferior olive and gigantocellular reticular formation. Projections from the ventral, parvicellular part of the nucleus are mostly, but not exclusively, directed to the rostral half of the brain stem and mainly terminate in the pararubral area, accessory oculomotor nuclei, pretectal areas, zona incerta, and in the parafascicular and ventrolateral thalamic nuclei. We conclude that the impact of the cerebellar nuclei on the brain stem is widespread; projections from different regions of the same cerebellar nucleus may show important differences in distribution of labeled terminals. On the other hand, injections placed in different cerebellar nuclei may result in a simila},

After injection of the tracer in the red nucleus (NR), retrograde labelling shows a topical arrangement of the cerebellorubral connection. The nucleus lateralis projects to the parvocellular NR (NRp) and the nucleus interpositus to the magnocellular NR (NRm). The nucleus interpositus anterior (NIA) reaches the entire NRm and this projection is topographically arranged: the medial NIA sends fibres ventrally, the lateral NIA dorsally. The medial two-thirds of the nucleus interpositus posterior (NIP) project only to the medial aspect of the NRm, with no apparent organization. No connection has been found between the lateral third of NIP and the NRm. After injection of the tracer in the spinal cord or the nucleus of the facial nerve, retrograde labelling is observed almost throughout the entire caudorostral extent of the NR, although labelling is more scant in NRp than in NRm. Rubrospinal and rubrofacial projections are somatotopically arranged in the dorsoventral direction: ventrolateral regions of NR reach the lumbar cord, medioventral regions the lower cervical levels, intermediary regions the upper cervical levels and finally the dorsalmost part of the NR projects to the nucleus of the facial nerve. After injection of the tracer in the cerebellar nuclei, anterograde labelling in the NR shows that interpositorubral connections determine two subregions in the NR: a lateral one under the exclusive control of the NIA, and a medial one under the control of both NIA-NIP afferents. It confirms in addition the topography of the NIA-NRm projection and shows the preponderant participation of the NIA afferents to the interpositorubral connection. Thus, it appears from our results that the cerebellorubral arrangement matches, to a great extent, the "rubromotor" efferent organization.},

  abstract = {The brain uses sensory feedback to correct behavioral errors. Larger errors by definition require greater corrections, and many models of learning assume that larger sensory feedback errors drive larger motor changes. However, an alternative perspective is that larger errors drive learning less effectively because such errors fall outside the range of errors normally experienced and are therefore unlikely to reflect accurate feedback. This is especially crucial in vocal control because auditory feedback can be contaminated by environmental noise or sensory processing errors. A successful control strategy must therefore rely on feedback to correct errors while disregarding aberrant auditory signals that would lead to maladaptive vocal corrections. We hypothesized that these constraints result in compensation that is greatest for smaller imposed errors and least for larger errors. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated the pitch of auditory feedback in singing Bengalese finches. We found that learning driven by larger sensory errors was both slower than that resulting from smaller errors and showed less complete compensation for the imposed error. Additionally, we found that a simple principle could account for these data: the amount of compensation was proportional to the overlap between the baseline distribution of pitch production and the distribution experienced during the shift. Correspondingly, the fraction of compensation approached zero when pitch was shifted outside of the song's baseline pitch distribution. Our data demonstrate that sensory errors drive learning best when they fall within the range of production variability, suggesting that learning is constrained by the statistics of sensorimotor experience.},

The prevailing model of basal ganglia function proposes that two orthogonal projection circuits originating from distinct populations of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) in the striatum--the so-called direct and indirect pathways--have opposing effects on movement: activity of direct-pathway SPNs is thought to facilitate movement, whereas activity of indirect-pathway SPNs is presumed to inhibit movement. This model has been difficult to test owing to the lack of methods to selectively measure the activity of direct- and indirect-pathway SPNs in freely moving animals. Here we develop a novel in vivo method to specifically measure direct- and indirect-pathway SPN activity, using Cre-dependent viral expression of the genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI) GCaMP3 in the dorsal striatum of D1-Cre (direct-pathway-specific) and A2A-Cre (indirect-pathway-specific) mice. Using fibre optics and time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) in mice performing an operant task, we observed transient increases in neural activity in both direct- and indirect-pathway SPNs when animals initiated actions, but not when they were inactive. Concurrent activation of SPNs from both pathways in one hemisphere preceded the initiation of contraversive movements and predicted the occurrence of specific movements within 500\,ms. These observations challenge the classical view of basal ganglia function and may have implications for understanding the origin of motor symptoms in basal ganglia disorders.},

  title = {Basal Ganglia and Cerebellar Loops: Motor and Cognitive Circuits.},
  volume = {31},
  abstract = {The traditional view that the basal ganglia and cerebellum are simply involved in the control of movement has been challenged in recent years. One of the pivotal reasons for this reappraisal has been new information about basal ganglia and cerebellar connections with the cerebral cortex. In essence, recent anatomical studies have revealed that these connections are organized into discrete circuits or 'loops'. Rather than serving as a means for widespread cortical areas to gain access to the motor system, these loops reciprocally interconnect a large and diverse set of cerebral cortical areas with the basal ganglia and cerebellum. The properties of neurons within the basal ganglia or cerebellar components of these circuits resembles the properties of neurons within the cortical areas subserved by these loops. For example, neuronal activity within basal ganglia and cerebellar loops with motor areas of the cerebral cortex is highly correlated with parameters of movement, while neuronal activity within basal ganglia and cerebellar loops with areas of the prefrontal cortex is more related to aspects of cognitive function. Thus, individual loops appear to be involved in distinct behavioral functions. Studies of basal ganglia and cerebellar pathology support this conclusion. Damage to the basal ganglia or cerebellar components of circuits with motor areas of cortex leads to motor symptoms, whereas damage of the subcortical components of circuits with non-motor areas of cortex causes higher-order deficits. In this report, we review some of the new anatomical, physiological and behavioral findings that have contributed to a reappraisal of function concerning the basal ganglia and cerebellar loops with the cerebral cortex.},

  abstract = {The role of the cerebellum in motor control and learning has been largely inferred from the effects of cerebellar damage. Recent work shows that cerebellar damage produces greater impairment of movements that require predictive as opposed to reactive control. This dissociation is consistent across many different types of movement. Predictive control is crucial for fast and ballistic movements, but impaired prediction can also affect slow movements, because of increased reliance on time-delayed feedback signals. The new findings are compatible with theories of cerebellar function, but still do not resolve whether the cerebellum operates by predicting the optimal motor commands or future sensory states. Prediction mechanisms must be learned and maintained through comparisons between predicted and observed outcomes. New results show that not all such error information is equivalent in driving cerebellar learning.},

Both nuclei are closely related to the habenulointerpeduncular tract, have similar cell types, and receive a dense projection from deep layers of the optic tectum, predominantly ipsilaterally, and a distinct projection from the dorsal column and external cuneate nuclei, predominantly contralaterally. Recordings of multiple unit activity evoked by visual and somatosensory stimuli were used to guide injections of tracer into either DLPc or Uva, and the projections to the telencephalon were charted. Both nuclei were found to have a major terminal field in the medial part of the ipsilateral neostriatum intermedium (NI), known as nucleus interfacialis (NIf) in songbirds, and a minor terminal field in the roof of the neostriatum caudale (NC). In pigeon, the DLPc terminations in NC were within a region known as neostriatum dorsale (Nd), and, in male songbirds, the Uva terminations were in the high vocal center (HVC). Recordings of visual and somatosensory evoked activity were then used to guide injections of tracer into NI, and the afferent and efferent projections were again compared in pigeon and songbirds. The projections from either DLPc or Uva were confirmed, and terminal fields were observed either in Nd in pigeon, the dorsolateral part of NC in female songbirds, or HVC in male songbirds. Injections of tracer into either Nd or HVC confirmed their sources of afferents in DLPc or Uva, respectively, and in NI, but there was incomplete overlap of the distribution of retrogradely labelled cells in NI and the terminal fields of DLPc or Uva. It is concluded that DLPc and Uva are comparable nuclei having similar afferent and efferent projections relaying visual and somatosensory information to the telencephalon. The possible role of this information in vocal control is discussed.},

In this review, we describe the role of behavioral analysis in facilitating cross-level integration. Modern sound analysis approaches allow investigation of developmental song learning across multiple time scales. Combined with novel methods that allow experimental control of vocal changes, it is now possible to test hypotheses about mechanisms of vocal learning. Further, song analysis can be done at the population level across generations to track cultural evolution and multigenerational behavioral processes. Complementing the investigation of song development with noninvasive brain imaging technology makes it now possible to study behavioral dynamics at multiple levels side by side with developmental changes in brain connectivity and in auditory responses.},

We experimentally induced death of specific HVC neuron types in adult male zebra finches using targeted photolysis. Induced death of a projection neuron type that normally turns over resulted in compensatory replacement of the same type. Induced death of the normally nonreplaced type did not stimulate their replacement. In juveniles, death of the latter type increased recruitment of the replaceable kind. We infer that neuronal death regulates the recruitment of replaceable neurons. Song deteriorated in some birds only after elimination of replaceable neurons. Behavioral deficits were transient and followed by variable degrees of recovery. This raises the possibility that induced neuronal replacement can restore a learned behavior.},

  abstract = {The gene encoding the forkhead box transcription factor, FOXP2, is essential for developing the full articulatory power of human language. Mutations of FOXP2 cause developmental verbal dyspraxia (DVD), a speech and language disorder that compromises the fluent production of words and the correct use and comprehension of grammar. FOXP2 patients have structural and functional abnormalities in the striatum of the basal ganglia, which also express high levels of FOXP2. Since human speech and learned vocalizations in songbirds bear behavioral and neural parallels, songbirds provide a genuine model for investigating the basic principles of speech and its pathologies. In zebra finch Area X, a basal ganglia structure necessary for song learning, FoxP2 expression increases during the time when song learning occurs. Here, we used lentivirus-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) to reduce FoxP2 levels in Area X during song development. Knockdown of FoxP2 resulted in an incomplete and inaccurate imitation of tutor song. Inaccurate vocal imitation was already evident early during song ontogeny and persisted into adulthood. The acoustic structure and the duration of adult song syllables were abnormally variable, similar to word production in children with DVD. Our findings provide the first example of a functional gene analysis in songbirds and suggest that normal auditory-guided vocal motor learning requires FoxP2.},

  doi = {10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0774-09.2009},
  abstract = {Estradiol impacts a wide variety of brain processes, including sex differentiation, mood, and learning. Here we show that estradiol regulates auditory processing of acoustic signals in the vertebrate brain, more specifically in the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM), the songbird analog of the mammalian auditory association cortex. Multielectrode recordings coupled with local pharmacological manipulations in awake animals reveal that both exogenous and locally generated estradiol increase auditory-evoked activity in NCM. This enhancement in neuronal responses is mediated by suppression of local inhibitory transmission. Surprisingly, we also found that estradiol is both necessary and sufficient for the induction of multiple mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent genes thought to be required for synaptic plasticity and memorization of birdsong. Specifically, we show that local blockade of estrogen receptors or aromatase activity in awake birds decrease song-induced MAPK-dependent gene expression. Infusions of estradiol in acoustically isolated birds induce transcriptional activation of these genes to levels comparable with song-stimulated animals. Our results reveal acute and rapid nongenomic functions for estradiol in central auditory physiology and suggest that such roles may be ubiquitously expressed across sensory systems.},

  abstract = {The steroid hormone estradiol plays an important role in reproductive development and behavior and modulates a wide array of physiological and cognitive processes. Recently, reports from several research groups have converged to show that estradiol also powerfully modulates sensory processing, specifically, the physiology of central auditory circuits in songbirds. These investigators have discovered that (1) behaviorally-relevant auditory experience rapidly increases estradiol levels in the auditory forebrain; (2) estradiol instantaneously enhances the responsiveness and coding efficiency of auditory neurons; (3) these changes are mediated by a non-genomic effect of brain-generated estradiol on the strength of inhibitory neurotransmission; and (4) estradiol regulates biochemical cascades that induce the expression of genes involved in synaptic plasticity. Together, these findings have established estradiol as a central regulator of auditory function and intensified the need to consider brain-based mechanisms, in addition to peripheral organ dysfunction, in hearing pathologies associated with estrogen deficiency.},

  abstract = {Avian song learning shares striking similarities with human speech acquisition and requires a basal ganglia (BG)-thalamo-cortical circuit. Information processing and transmission speed in the BG is thought to be limited by synaptic architecture of two serial inhibitory connections. Propagation speed may be critical in the avian BG circuit given the temporally precise control of musculature during vocalization. We used electrical stimulation of the cortical inputs to the BG to study, with fine time resolution, the functional connectivity within this network. We found that neurons in thalamic and cortical nuclei that are not directly connected with the stimulated area can respond to the stimulation with extremely short latencies. Through pharmacological manipulations, we trace this property back to the BG and show that the cortical stimulation triggers fast disinhibition of the thalamic neurons. Surprisingly, feedforward inhibition mediated by striatal inhibitory neurons onto BG output neurons sometimes precedes the monosynaptic excitatory drive from cortical afferents. The fast feedforward inhibition lengthens a single interspike interval in BG output neurons by just a few milliseconds. This short delay is sufficient to drive a strong, brief increase in firing probability in the target thalamic neurons, evoking short-latency responses. By blocking glutamate receptors in vivo, we show that thalamic responses do not appear to rely on excitatory drive, and we show in a theoretical model that they could be mediated by postinhibitory rebound properties. Such fast signaling through disinhibition and rebound may be a crucial specialization for learning of rapid and temporally precise motor acts such as vocal communication.},

  abstract = {Birdsong is a complex vocalization composed of various song elements organized according to sequential rules. Two alternative views exist that explain the neural representation of song element sequences in the songbird brain. The finding of sequential selective neurons supports the idea that the song element sequence is encoded in a chain of rigid selective neurons. Alternatively, song structure could be encoded in an ensemble of relatively broad selective neurons arranged in a distributed manner. Here we attempted to determine which neural representation actually occurs in the song system by recording neural responses to various stimuli and performing information-theoretic analysis on the data obtained. We recorded the neural responses to all possible element pairs of stimuli in the Bengalese finch brain nucleus high vocal centre (HVC). Our results showed that each neuron has broad but differential response properties to element sequences beyond the structure of self-generated song. To quantify the transmitted information by such a broadly tuned neural population, we calculated the time course of mutual information between auditory stimuli and neural activities. Confounded information, which represents the relationship between present and previous elements, increased significantly immediately after stimulus presentation. These results indicate that the song element sequence is encoded in a neural ensemble in the HVC via population coding. These findings give us a new encoding scheme for the song element sequence using a distributed neural representation rather than the chain model of rigid selective neurons.},

To achieve this, we applied a multivariate Poisson distribution with correlation terms for the output distribution of HMMs. We formulated a variational Bayes (VB) inference for the model. The VB could automatically determine the appropriate number of hidden states and correlation types while avoiding the overlearning problem. We developed an efficient algorithm for computing posteriors using the recursive relationship of a multivariate Poisson distribution.

The songs of birds with multi-phrase organization changed into simpler, mono-phrase songs. This is the first demonstration of the NIfs involvement in the production of birdsong.

  abstract = {Bird song represents a powerful model system for many of the important problems in behavioral neurobiology, offering both easily measured sensory and motor patterns and a discrete neural effector system. Methods were developed to record the discharge of neurons in singing birds to examine the functions of nuclei in the song control pathway previously implicated anatomically. In several cases, lesions and other techniques were employed to test predictions derived from electrode recordings. Four major findings emerge from these studies. Single-unit recordings from telencephalic nucleus hyperstriatum ventrale, pars caudale (HVc) show several classes of neurons with apparently specialized roles in song production and/or sensorimotor interaction. The nucleus interfacialis (Nlf; Nottebohm, 1980), which provides an input to HVc and is anatomically the "highest" nucleus in the descending motor pathway, is uniquely placed among vocal control nuclei to be a generator of timing cues for song. Consistent with the unidirectional connections between nuclei of the descending pathway, Nlf, HVc, and nucleus robustus archistriatalis (RA) are activated sequentially prior to sound onset. Three other nuclei with connections to or from the descending tract do not show song-related activity in the adult. Bilateral HVc recordings and peripheral disruptions of the vocal apparatus suggest that both hemispheres and syringeal halves normally make similar contributions to most if not all song syllables. The latter finding casts doubt on the analogy between neural lateralization in bird song and in human speech.},

Visuomotor rotation and force-field tasks impose systematic errors and thereby emphasize adaptation. In skill learning tasks, which for the most part do not involve a perturbation, improved performance is manifest as reduced motor variability and probably depends less on adaptation and more on success-based exploration.

  abstract = {Behavioural studies widely implicate sleep in memory consolidation in the learning of a broad range of behaviours. During sleep, brain regions are reactivated, and specific patterns of neural activity are replayed, consistent with patterns observed in previous waking behaviour. Birdsong learning is a paradigmatic model system for skill learning. Song development in juvenile zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) is characterized by sleep-dependent circadian fluctuations in singing behaviour, with immediate post-sleep deterioration in song structure followed by recovery later in the day. In sleeping adult birds, spontaneous bursting activity of forebrain premotor neurons in the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) carries information about daytime singing. Here we show that, in juvenile zebra finches, playback during the day of an adult 'tutor' song induced profound and tutor-song-specific changes in bursting activity of RA neurons during the following night of sleep. The night-time neuronal changes preceded tutor-song-induced changes in singing, first observed the following day. Interruption of auditory feedback greatly reduced sleep bursting and prevented the tutor-song-specific neuronal remodelling. Thus, night-time neuronal activity is shaped by the interaction of the song model (sensory template) and auditory feedback, with changes in night-time activity preceding the onset of practice associated with vocal learning. We hypothesize that night-time bursting induces adaptive changes in premotor networks during sleep as part of vocal learning. By this hypothesis, adaptive changes driven by replay of sensory information at night and by evaluation of sensory feedback during the day interact to produce the complex circadian patterns seen early in vocal development.},

By comparing their own sounds to the song of a tutor, young songbirds gradually converge to a stable song that can be a remarkably good copy of the tutor song. Here we show that vocal variability in the learning songbird is induced by a basal-ganglia-related circuit, the output of which projects to the motor pathway via the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the nidopallium (LMAN). We found that pharmacological inactivation of LMAN dramatically reduced acoustic and sequence variability in the songs of juvenile zebra finches, doing so in a rapid and reversible manner. In addition, recordings from LMAN neurons projecting to the motor pathway revealed highly variable spiking activity across song renditions, showing that LMAN may act as a source of variability. Lastly, pharmacological blockade of synaptic inputs from LMAN to its target premotor area also reduced song variability. Our results establish that, in the juvenile songbird, the exploratory motor behavior required to learn a complex motor sequence is dependent on a dedicated neural circuit homologous to cortico-basal ganglia circuits in mammals.},

Neurons in one potential site of sensorimotor integration, the forebrain nucleus HVc, have premotor activity during singing and auditory activity during playback of the bird's own song. It is not known whether the high degree of selectivity for learned features of song observed during playback arises in HVc or also in structures afferent to HVc. We recorded in anesthetized adult zebra finches from two structures afferent to HVc: either the nucleus interfacialis (NIf) or the L1 subdivision of the field L complex, and simultaneously from a second electrode in HVc. Correlations in the bursting pattern of ongoing activity of HVc and NIf recordings were observed; these helped to localize the first electrode to NIf recording sites. Most NIf neurons exhibited song-selective responses, but as a population, they were less selective than were HVc neurons. Most L1 neurons were not song-selective. NIf neurons have also been reported to have premotor activity during singing; thus, NIf is another potential site of auditory-motor interactions in the song system. Evidence gathered to date suggests that those brain areas in the passerine forebrain that are recruited during song production also display the most selective learned auditory responses.},

HVc in males comprises three cytoarchitectonic subdivisions: the commonly recognized central region with large and medium-sized darkly staining cells, a ventral caudomedial region with densely packed small and medium-sized cells, and a dorsolateral region with oblong cells and rows of cells. All three subdivisions project to area X and the robust nucleus of the archistriatum, with more complexity in the classes and distribution of cells than previously reported. In females, HVc is very small and has a cytoarchitecture distinct from that of the three male subdivisions. The structure of HVc in females treated with estradiol at 15 days of age is similar to male HVc. Tracer studies in males with fluorescent and biotinylated dextrans demonstrate non-topographic projections onto HVc that may carry auditory information, including type 1 and type 2 neurons in subdivisions L1 and L3 of the field L complex, a class of neurons in nucleus interface, nucleus uvaeformis, the caudal neostriatum ventral to HVc, and intrinsic HVc connections. These data are interpreted in terms of HVc's functional properties. Additionally, the neostriatum immediately ventral to HVc receives projections from field L, ventral hyperstriatum, and caudal neostriatum, and projects to a region surrounding RA and near to or into area X. The similarity of the connectivity of HVc and adjacent neostriatum suggests the possibility that they share a common origin.},

  abstract = {Songbirds learn to sing by memorizing a tutor song that they then vocally mimic using auditory feedback. This developmental sequence suggests that brain areas that encode auditory memories communicate with brain areas for learned vocal control. In the songbird, the secondary auditory telencephalic region caudal mesopallium (CM) contains neurons that encode aspects of auditory experience. We investigated whether CM is an important source of auditory input to two sensorimotor structures implicated in singing, the telencephalic song nucleus interface (NIf) and HVC. We used reversible inactivation methods to show that activity in CM is necessary for much of the auditory-evoked activity that can be detected in NIf and HVC of anesthetized adult male zebra finches. Furthermore, extracellular and intracellular recordings along with spike-triggered averaging methods indicate that auditory selectivity for the bird's own song is enhanced between CM and NIf. We used lentiviral-mediated tracing methods to confirm that CM neurons directly innervate NIf. To our surprise, these tracing studies also revealed a direct projection from CM to HVC. We combined irreversible lesions of NIf with reversible inactivation of CM to establish that CM supplies a direct source of auditory drive to HVC. Finally, using chronic recording methods, we found that CM neurons are active in response to song playback and during singing, indicating their potential importance to song perception and processing of auditory feedback. These results establish the functional synaptic linkage between sites of auditory and vocal learning and may identify an important substrate for learned vocal communication.},

  abstract = {Many complex behaviours, like speech or music, have a hierarchical organization with structure on many timescales, but it is not known how the brain controls the timing of behavioural sequences, or whether different circuits control different timescales of the behaviour. Here we address these issues by using temperature to manipulate the biophysical dynamics in different regions of the songbird forebrain involved in song production. We find that cooling the premotor nucleus HVC (formerly known as the high vocal centre) slows song speed across all timescales by up to 45 per cent but only slightly alters the acoustic structure, whereas cooling the downstream motor nucleus RA (robust nucleus of the arcopallium) has no observable effect on song timing. Our observations suggest that dynamics within HVC are involved in the control of song timing, perhaps through a chain-like organization. Local manipulation of brain temperature should be broadly applicable to the identification of neural circuitry that controls the timing of behavioural sequences and, more generally, to the study of the origin and role of oscillatory and other forms of brain dynamics in neural systems.},

In this review I will discuss three different neural systems that are linked by this theme. The pyloric network of the lobster, the song control system of the zebra finch, and the odor encoding system of the locust, while different in design, all contain degeneracies between their internal parameters and the outputs they encode. Indeed, although the dynamics of song generation and odor identification are quite different, computationally, odor recognition can be thought of as running the song generation circuitry backwards. In both of these systems, degeneracy plays a vital role in mapping a sparse neural representation devoid of correlations onto external stimuli (odors or song structure) that are strongly correlated. I argue that degeneracy between input and output states is an inherent feature of many neural systems, which can be exploited as a fault-tolerant method of reliably learning, generating, and discriminating closely related patterns.},

First, we hypothesize that the sequential order of bursting is reflected in the excitatory synaptic connections between neurons. Second, we propose that the neurons are intrinsically bursting, so that burst duration is set by cellular properties. Our model generates burst sequences similar to those observed in HVC. If intrinsic bursting is removed from the model, burst sequences can also be produced. However, they require more fine-tuning of synaptic strengths, and are therefore less robust. In our model, intrinsic bursting is caused by dendritic calcium spikes, and strong spike frequency adaptation in the soma contributes to burst termination.},

Eighteen subjects produced vowels under a control (normal F0 feedback) and two experimental conditions: F0 shifted up and F0 shifted down. In each experimental condition subjects produced vowels during a training period in which their F0 was slowly shifted without their awareness. Following this exposure to transformed F0, their acoustic feedback was returned to normal. Two effects were observed. Subjects compensated for the change in F0 and showed negative aftereffects. When F0 feedback was returned to normal, the subjects modified their produced F0 in the opposite direction to the shift. The results suggest that fundamental frequency is controlled using auditory feedback and with reference to an internal pitch representation. This is consistent with current work on internal models of speech motor control.},

  abstract = {Spoken language exists because of a remarkable neural process. Inside a speaker's brain, an intended message gives rise to neural signals activating the muscles of the vocal tract. The process is remarkable because these muscles are activated in just the right way that the vocal tract produces sounds a listener understands as the intended message. What is the best approach to understanding the neural substrate of this crucial motor control process? One of the key recent modeling developments in neuroscience has been the use of state feedback control (SFC) theory to explain the role of the CNS in motor control. SFC postulates that the CNS controls motor output by (1) estimating the current dynamic state of the thing (e.g., arm) being controlled, and (2) generating controls based on this estimated state. SFC has successfully predicted a great range of non-speech motor phenomena, but as yet has not received attention in the speech motor control community. Here, we review some of the key characteristics of speech motor control and what they say about the role of the CNS in the process. We then discuss prior efforts to model the role of CNS in speech motor control, and argue that these models have inherent limitations - limitations that are overcome by an SFC model of speech motor control which we describe. We conclude by discussing a plausible neural substrate of our model.},

We simultaneously recorded from presynaptic pallidal axon terminals and postsynaptic thalamocortical neurons in a basal ganglia-recipient thalamic nucleus that is necessary for vocal variability and learning in zebra finches. We found that song-locked rate modulations in the thalamus could not be explained by pallidal inputs alone and persisted following pallidal lesion. Instead, thalamic activity was likely driven by inputs from a motor cortical nucleus that is also necessary for singing. These findings suggest a role for cortical inputs to the pallido-recipient thalamus in driving premotor signals that are important for exploratory behavior and learning.},

Numerous studies demonstrate that spike-time-dependent plasticity (STDP), the primary known mechanism for temporal order learning in neurons, cannot organize networks to generate long sequences, raising the question of how such networks are formed. We show that heterosynaptic competition within single neurons, when combined with STDP, organizes networks to generate long unary activity sequences even without sequential training inputs. The network produces a diversity of sequences with a power law length distribution and exponent -1, independent of cellular time constants. We show evidence for a similar distribution of sequence lengths in the recorded premotor song activity of songbirds. These results suggest that neural sequences may be shaped by synaptic constraints and network circuitry rather than cellular time constants.},

  abstract = {Most of our motor skills are not innately programmed, but are learned by a combination of motor exploration and performance evaluation, suggesting that they proceed through a reinforcement learning (RL) mechanism. Songbirds have emerged as a model system to study how a complex behavioral sequence can be learned through an RL-like strategy. Interestingly, like motor sequence learning in mammals, song learning in birds requires a basal ganglia (BG)-thalamocortical loop, suggesting common neural mechanisms. Here, we outline a specific working hypothesis for how BG-forebrain circuits could utilize an internally computed reinforcement signal to direct song learning. Our model includes a number of general concepts borrowed from the mammalian BG literature, including a dopaminergic reward prediction error and dopamine-mediated plasticity at corticostriatal synapses. We also invoke a number of conceptual advances arising from recent observations in the songbird. Specifically, there is evidence for a specialized cortical circuit that adds trial-to-trial variability to stereotyped cortical motor programs, and a role for the BG in "biasing" this variability to improve behavioral performance. This BG-dependent "premotor bias" may in turn guide plasticity in downstream cortical synapses to consolidate recently learned song changes. Given the similarity between mammalian and songbird BG-thalamocortical circuits, our model for the role of the BG in this process may have broader relevance to mammalian BG function.},

To distinguish between two possible classes of models of neural sequence generation, we carried out intracellular recordings of HVC neurons in singing zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). We found that the subthreshold membrane potential is characterized by a large, rapid depolarization 5-10 ms before burst onset, consistent with a synaptically connected chain of neurons in HVC. We found no evidence for the slow membrane potential modulation predicted by models in which burst timing is controlled by subthreshold dynamics. Furthermore, bursts ride on an underlying depolarization of {$\sim$}10-ms duration, probably the result of a regenerative calcium spike within HVC neurons that could facilitate the propagation of activity through a chain network with high temporal precision. Our results provide insight into the fundamental mechanisms by which neural circuits can generate complex sequential behaviours.},

We have examined the activity of identified HVC neurons of zebra finches during singing. Antidromic activation was used to identify three classes of HVC cells: neurons projecting to the premotor nucleus RA, neurons projecting to area X in the AFP, and putative HVC interneurons. HVC interneurons are active throughout the song and display tonic patterns of activity. Projection neurons exhibit highly phasic stereotyped firing patterns. X-projecting (HVC((X))) neurons burst zero to four times per motif, whereas RA-projecting neurons burst extremely sparsely--at most once per motif. The bursts of HVC projection neurons are tightly locked to the song and typically have a jitter of {$<$}1 ms. Population activity of interneurons, but not projection neurons, was significantly correlated with syllable patterns. Consistent with the idea that HVC codes for the temporal order in the song rather than for sound, the vocal dynamics and neural dynamics in HVC occur on different and uncorrelated time scales. We test whether HVC((X)) neurons are auditory sensitive during singing. We recorded the activity of these neurons in juvenile birds during singing and found that firing patterns of these neurons are not altered by distorted auditory feedback, which is known to disrupt learning or to cause degradation of song already learned.},

We found that large bilateral lesions to the songbird BG homolog Area X had little or no effect on song variability during vocal babbling. In contrast, lesions to the BG-recipient thalamic nucleus DLM (medial portion of the dorsolateral thalamus) largely abolished normal vocal babbling in young birds and caused a dramatic increase in song stereotypy. These findings support the idea that the motor thalamus plays a key role in the expression of exploratory juvenile behaviors during learning.},

Signatures of low-dimensional chaos such as subharmonic bifurcations have been reported in adult and developing zebra finch song. Here, we use methods from nonlinear dynamics to test whether adult male zebra finches (Taenopygia guttata) use the intrinsic nonlinear properties of their vocal organ, the syrinx, to insert subharmonic transitions in their song. In contrast to previous data on the basis of spectrographic evidence, we show that subharmonic transitions do not occur in adult song. Subharmonic transitions also do not arise in artificially induced sound in the intact syrinx, but are commonly generated in the excised syrinx. These findings suggest that subharmonic transitions are not used to increase song complexity, and that the brain controls song in a surprisingly smooth control regimen. Fast, smooth changes in acoustic elements can be produced by direct motor control in a stereotyped fashion, which is a more reliable indicator of male fitness than abrupt acoustic changes that do not require similarly precise control. Consistent with this view is the presence of high fidelity at every level of motor control, from telencephalic premotor areas to superfast syringeal muscles.},

  abstract = {Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying serially ordered behavior is a fundamental problem in motor learning. We present a computational model of sensorimotor learning in songbirds that is constrained by the known functional anatomy of the song circuit. The model subsumes our companion model for learning individual song "syllables" and relies on the same underlying assumptions. The extended model addresses the problem of learning to produce syllables in the correct sequence. Central to our approach is the hypothesis that the Anterior Forebrain Pathway (AFP) produces signals related to the comparison of the bird's own vocalizations and a previously memorized "template." This "AFP comparison hypothesis" is challenged by the lack of a direct projection from the AFP to the song nucleus HVc, a candidate site for the generator of song sequence. We propose that sequence generation in HVc results from an associative chain of motor and sensory representations (motor --{$>$} sensory --{$>$} next motor. ) encoded within the two known populations of HVc projection neurons. The sensory link in the chain is provided, not by auditory feedback, but by a centrally generated efference copy that serves as an internal prediction of this feedback. The use of efference copy as a substitute for the sensory signal explains the ability of adult birds to produce normal song immediately after deafening. We also predict that the AFP guides sequence learning by biasing motor activity in nucleus RA, the premotor nucleus downstream of HVc. Associative learning then remaps the output of the HVc sequence generator. By altering the motor pathway in RA, the AFP alters the correspondence between HVc motor commands and the resulting sensory feedback and triggers renewed efference copy learning in HVc. Thus, auditory feedback-mediated efference copy learning provides an indirect pathway by which the AFP can influence sequence generation in HVc. The model makes predictions concerning the role played by specific neural populations during the sensorimotor phase of song learning and demonstrates how simple rules of associational plasticity can contribute to the learning of a complex behavior on multiple time scales.},

  abstract = {Auditory neurons of the anterior forebrain (AF) in adult zebra finches are highly selective for the bird's own song (BOS): they respond more to BOS than to songs of other zebra finches (conspecifics) and to BOS played in reverse. In contrast, juvenile AF neurons are not selective at 30 d of age, responding equally well to all song stimuli. Both BOS and tutor song experience are required by juveniles for normal song learning and may produce the selective properties of adult neurons. Because such selectivity could subserve song learning, it is important to determine when it arises. Birds were therefore studied at an intermediate stage of learning, after substantial experience of both tutor song and their own developing (plastic) song. Extracellular single neuron recordings in 60-d-old zebra finches revealed that AF neurons had significant song and order selectivity for both tutor song and BOS (the bird's plastic song). The degree of BOS selectivity was less than that found in adults, as indicated in part by 60 d neurons that were sensitive to the local order within syllables but not yet to the global order of syllables within a song. When responses to BOS and tutor song were compared, most neurons preferred BOS, some preferred tutor song, and others responded equally to both stimuli. The latter type of neuron was not simply immature, because many of these neurons responded significantly more to BOS and tutor song than to conspecific and reverse songs. The selectivity of AF neurons at 60 d is markedly different from the unselective properties of neurons at 30 d and may function in vocal learning at this stage. Moreover, the selectivity for both BOS and tutor song raises the possibility that both aspects of the birds' sensory experience during learning are reflected in properties of AF neurons.},

  abstract = {Song is a learned vocal behavior influenced by social interactions. Prior work has suggested that the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP), a specialized pallial-basal ganglia circuit critical for vocal plasticity, mediates the influence of social signals on song. Here, we investigate the signals the AFP sends to song motor areas and their dependence on social context by characterizing singing-related activity of single neurons in the AFP output nucleus LMAN (lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium). We show that interaction with females causes marked, real-time changes in firing properties of individual LMAN neurons. When males sing to females ("directed"), LMAN neurons exhibit reliable firing of single spikes precisely locked to song. In contrast, when males sing alone ("undirected"), the same LMAN neurons exhibit prominent burst firing and trial-by-trial variability. Burst structure and timing vary substantially across repeated undirected trials. Despite context-dependent differences in firing statistics, the average pattern of song-locked firing for an individual neuron is similar across behavioral contexts, suggesting a common underlying signal. Different LMAN neurons in the same bird, however, exhibit distinct firing patterns, suggesting that subsets of neurons jointly encode song features. Together, our findings demonstrate that behavioral interactions reversibly transform the signaling mode of LMAN neurons. Such changes may contribute to rapid switching of motor activity between variable and precise states. More generally, our results suggest that pallial-basal ganglia circuits contribute to motor learning and production through multiple mechanisms: patterned signals could guide changes in motor output while state-dependent variability could subserve motor exploration.},

We show that the deleterious effects on song production that normally follow deafening can be prevented by a second insult to the nervous system--the lesion of a basal ganglia-forebrain circuit. The results suggest that the removal of auditory feedback leads to the generation of an instructive signal that actively drives non-adaptive changes in song; they also suggest that this instructive signal is generated within (or conveyed through) the basal ganglia-forebrain pathway. Our findings provide evidence that cortical-basal ganglia circuits may participate in the evaluation of sensory feedback during calibration of motor performance, and demonstrate that damage to such circuits can have little effect on previously learned behaviour while conspicuously disrupting the capacity to adaptively modify that behaviour.},

Both humans and songbirds learn their complex vocalizations early in life, exhibiting a strong dependence on hearing the adults they will imitate, as well as themselves as they practice, and a waning of this dependence as they mature. Innate predispositions for perceiving and learning the correct sounds exist in both groups, although more evidence of innate descriptions of species-specific signals exists in songbirds, where numerous species of vocal learners have been compared. Humans also share with songbirds an early phase of learning that is primarily perceptual, which then serves to guide later vocal production. Both humans and songbirds have evolved a complex hierarchy of specialized forebrain areas in which motor and auditory centers interact closely, and which control the lower vocal motor areas also found in nonlearners. In both these vocal learners, however, how auditory feedback of self is processed in these brain areas is surprisingly unclear. Finally, humans and songbirds have similar critical periods for vocal learning, with a much greater ability to learn early in life. In both groups, the capacity for late vocal learning may be decreased by the act of learning itself, as well as by biological factors such as the hormones of puberty. Although some features of birdsong and speech are clearly not analogous, such as the capacity of language for meaning, abstraction, and flexible associations, there are striking similarities in how sensory experience is internalized and used to shape vocal outputs, and how learning is enhanced during a critical period of development. Similar neural mechanisms may therefore be involved.},

  abstract = {Birdsong is a learned behavior that is controlled by a group of identified nuclei, known collectively as the song system. The cortical nucleus HVC (used as a proper name) is a focal point of many investigations as it is necessary for song production, song learning, and receives selective auditory information. HVC receives input from several sources including the cortical area MMAN (medial magnocellular nucleus of the nidopallium). The MMAN to HVC connection is particularly interesting as it provides potential sensorimotor feedback to HVC. To begin to understand the role of this connection, we investigated the physiological relation between MMAN and HVC activity with simultaneous multiunit extracellular recordings from these two nuclei in urethane anesthetized zebra finches. As previously reported, we found similar timing in spontaneous bursts of activity in MMAN and HVC. Like HVC, MMAN responds to auditory playback of the bird's own song (BOS), but had little response to reversed BOS or conspecific song. Stimulation of MMAN resulted in evoked activity in HVC, indicating functional excitation from MMAN to HVC. However, inactivation of MMAN resulted in no consistent change in auditory responses in HVC. Taken together, these results indicate that MMAN provides functional excitatory input to HVC but does not provide significant auditory input to HVC in anesthetized animals. We hypothesize that MMAN may play a role in motor reinforcement or coordination, or may provide modulatory input to the song system about the internal state of the animal as it receives input from the hypothalamus.},

  abstract = {The paleostriatal complex (PC) of the pigeon lies in the baso-lateral wall of telencephalon, and consists of three major subdivisions: the paleostriatum augmentatum (PA), paleostriatum primitivum (PP), and nucleus intrapeduncularis (INP). The lobus parolfactorius (LPO) lies on the medial aspect of PA and has often been considered to be part of PA. The present study of afferent and efferent connections of the paleostriatal complex supports earlier Previous suggestions that the PC is directly comparable to the basal ganglia of mammalia. High concentrations of acetylcholinesterase were found in the PA, LPO and INP. Intense yellowish green fluorescence, probably dopamine, was confined to the PA and LPO. Stereotaxic lesions were placed in either the dorsal ventricular ridge structures above the PC (n e e and hyperstriaturn), PA, LPO or PP-INP, and animals sacri-ficed from one to six days postoperatively. The brains were stained with the Fink-Heimer methods for the demonstration of degenerating axons and termi-nals. The region of the neo-and hyperstriatum was found to project upon the PA, in a seemingly topographic manner. PA was found to project topographically upon the PP and INP. In contrast, the LPO contributed to the medial forebrain bundle, terminating in the rostral lateral hypothalamus. LPO does not appear to project to the PP or INP. Lesions of PP-INP resulted in massive degeneration of a descending tract, the ansa lenticularis. Terminal degeneration was found in the anterior and posterior nuclei of the ansa lenticularis of the ventral diencephalon, nucleus dorsalis in-termedius posterior and nucleus spiriformis lateralis of the dorsal thalamus, and the nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus pars compacta et disseminata of the isthmic tegmentum. In these several features of histochemical and hodological organization the PC alone appears similar to the caudate-putamen and globus pallidus complex of mammalian brains. More specifically, the PA resembles the caudate-putamen, whereas PP and INP resemble the external and internal divisions of the globus pallidus, respectively. Similarities and differences between avian and mammalian brains, and the re-lationship of the present study of the PC and previous studies of the dorsal ven-tricular ridge structures are discussed (Karten, '69; Nauta and Karten, '70).},

  abstract = {The mammalian motor cortex typically innervates motor neurons indirectly via oligosynaptic pathways. However, evolution of skilled digit movements in humans, apes, and some monkey species is associated with the emergence of abundant monosynaptic cortical projections onto spinal motor neurons innervating distal limb muscles. Rats perform skilled movements with their whiskers, and we examined the possibility that the rat vibrissa motor cortex (VMC) projects monosynaptically onto facial motor neurons controlling the whisker movements. First, single injections of lentiviruses to VMC sites identified by intracortical microstimulations were used to label a distinct subpopulation of VMC axons or presynaptic terminals by expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) or GFP-tagged synaptophysin, respectively. Four weeks after the injections, GFP and synaptophysin-GFP labeling of axons and putative presynaptic terminals was detected in the lateral portion of the facial nucleus (FN), in close proximity to motor neurons identified morphologically and by axonal back-labeling from the whisker follicles. The VMC projections were detected bilaterally, with threefold larger density of labeling in the contralateral FN. Next, multiple VMC injections were used to label a large portion of VMC axons, resulting in overall denser but still laterally restricted FN labeling. Ultrastructural analysis of the GFP-labeled VMC axons confirmed the existence of synaptic contacts onto dendrites and somata of FN motor neurons. These findings provide anatomical demonstration of monosynaptic VMC-to-FN pathway in the rat and show that lentivirus-based expression of GFP and GFP-tagged presynaptic proteins can be used as a high-resolution neuroanatomical tracing method.},

For this purpose, the left motorcortex was exposed in three animals under narcosis. By electrical brain stimulation, sites were identified yielding vocal fold adduction. Effective sites were injected with the anterograde tracer biotin dextran amine. Subcortical projections could be traced within the forebrain to the putamen, caudate nucleus, claustrum, zona incerta, field H of Forel and a number of thalamic nuclei, with the heaviest projections to the nuclei ventralis lateralis, ventralis posteromedialis, including its parvocellular part, medialis dorsalis, centralis medialis, centrum medianum and reuniens.

The fact that monkeys, in contrast to humans, lack a direct connection of the motorcortex with the laryngeal motoneurons suggests that this connection has evolved in the last few million years and might represent one of the factors that made speech evolution possible. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Following injections of horseradish peroxidase into the superior colliculus, retrogradely labeled cells occupy the ventral one-third of the contralateral principal sensory and spinal trigeminal nucleus; trigeminocollicular neurons are especially numerous within the subnucleus interpolaris (Svi). Injections of either 3H-proline or horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into the Svi reveal that trigeminocollicular axons reach the rostral two-thirds to three-quarters of the contralateral superior colliculus, where they distribute in a nonuniform, patchy manner within layers IV-VI. In addition to demonstrating the trigeminocollicular projection, anterograde and retrograde transport studies of the Svi also reveal a trigeminoolivary projection which terminates primarily within the contralateral rostral dorsal accessory (DAO) and adjacent principal (PO) olives; some of the Svi neurons innervate both the superior colliculus and the DAO-PO via axon collaterals. Data from a final set of retrograde tracing experiments show that the trigeminorecipient zone of the DAO-PO contains neurons which project to crura I and/or II of the cerebellar cortex. Of the various submodalities conveyed by the trigeminal system, it is likely that the trigeminal connections we have demonstrated are carrying tactile information. This is indicated by the fact that responses to tactile stimulation of the face have been reported for cells in (1) the deeper collicular layers, (2) the trigeminorecipient zone of the DAO-PO, and (3) cerebellar targets of this zone, crura I and II.

In the present study, extracellular recordings demonstrated a high percentage of units within rFN, as well as in adjacent areas, which responded to induction of acute increases or decreases in arterial blood pressure. Furthermore, units were identified in rFN which responded to respiratory stimuli as well as to changes in blood pressure. Out of the population tested, no units responding to respiratory stimuli were found in areas adjacent to rFN. In addition, a high percentage of neurons tested for response to passive movement also showed changes in firing rate to either cardiovascular or respiratory challenges, or both. Several units were identified (mostly in rFN), whose basal firing pattern was respiratory-related. This suggests the presence of cell bodies of origin within the rFN whose function is related to cardiorespiratory activity. \textcopyright{} 1989.},

Other RRNs (27\%) showed a respiration-related pattern independent of respiratory movement performance. Repeated electrical stimulation of the inferior olive exerted a synchronizing effect on the firing rate of 24\% of the RRNs.

Such coordination depends upon the integrity of the inferior olive, a major cerebellar afferent, as its lesion produces ataxic and dysmetric movement abnormalities. Using multiple-microelectrode recordings, we report here that there are domains of Purkinje cell activity that are generated by olivary input during skilled tongue movements in rats. Such activity domains are highly rhythmic and time-locked to movement. Patterns of synchronous olivocerebellar activity are geometrically complex and can change during a sequence of movements. The results support the view that the inferior olive organizes movement in time, by entraining motor-neuronal firing through rhythmic activation of the cerebellum, and in space, by synchronously activating cell ensembles that allow the use of individual muscles. Dynamic repatterning of olivocerebellar synchrony may allow different combinations of muscles to be used for movements intended to have varying spatial structures.},

We combined fluorescent retrograde tracers with a double anterograde labeling technique. Multiple injections of a combination of Diamidino Yellow and Fast Blue were made into either the MI or SMA hand/arm representation as determined by intracortical microstimulation. In the same animal, biotinylated dextran amine was injected into the GPi and horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin was injected into the contralateral cerebellar nuclei. The results revealed that the cerebellar and pallidal thalamic territories are largely separate. The ventral anterior nucleus (VA) and the ventral lateral nucleus pars oralis (VLo) contained a greater density of pallidal labeling while a greater density of cerebellar label was observed more caudally in the ventral posterior lateral nucleus pars oralis (VPLo) as well as in nucleus X (X). Moreover, we observed that the greatest coincidence of retrograde cell labeling was within the pallidal thalamic territory following the SMA injections and within the cerebellar thalamic territory following the MI injections. However, interdigitating foci of pallidal and cerebellar label were also observed particularly in the ventral lateral nucleus pars oralis (VLo) and the ventral lateral nucleus pars caudalis (VLc). In both VLo and VLc, we additionally observed coincidence between the cerebellar labeling and SMA projection neurons as well as between pallidal labeling and MI projection neurons. These data suggest that while MI primarily receives inputs originating from Cb and SMA primarily receives inputs originating from GPi, it also appears that MI and SMA receive secondary afferents arising from GPi and Cb, respectively.},

  abstract = {Three monkeys were trained to perform stereotyped wrist movements to track a target (phase 1). Changing the gain between the wrist movement and visual display required the monkey to adapt its wrist movement. This adaptation consisted of progressive reduction of movement amplitude over a number of trials (phase 2) until a stereotyped movement accommodating the new gain was learned (phase 3). The experiment's aim was to investigate whether cerebellar thalamic neuronal discharge (ND) changed during motor adaptation and whether this change was related to scaling of kinematic parameters or movement error. Extracellular single-cell recordings were made from "wrist-related" neurones in the cerebellar thalamus (59) and the nucleus ventro-posterior lateralis caudalis (VPLc) (37) of each monkey while they performed the movement paradigm. Neurones were selected for further analysis (37/59 cerebellar thalamic and 23/37 VPLc) if phase-1 movements were stereotyped and motor adaptation occurred in phase 2 (according to statistical definitions). When the gain initially changed, there were positional errors in the form of overshoot. Adaptation to the new gain was achieved by a variety of strategies, including modification of the amplitude of kinematic parameters and positional error in addition to reduction of time to peak velocity and movement time. During stereotyped movements, most cerebellar thalamic neurones fired before movement onset and before VPLc neurones. During adaptation, this order of onset of firing was reversed, and cerebellar thalamic neurones discharged after VPLc neurones and close to the onset of movement. During motor adaptation, the mean rate of phasic ND rose in a large proportion of cerebellar thalamic and VPLc neurones, and the proportion of cerebellar thalamic neurones that encoded a signal about positional error and movement amplitude also increased. In addition, there is set-related activity in the discharge of a majority of cerebellar thalamic and VPLc neurones. This does not appear to be specifically related to motor adaptation, but is related to the movement amplitude. We have discussed the role of the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway in error detection in the light of the similarities between discharge patterns of cerebellar thalamic and VPLc neurones. We speculate that, when learned movements are performed, the discharge of cerebellar thalamic neurones occurs before movement, perhaps representing an efference copy of the intended movement. During adaptation, this signal is gated out, and later-arriving peripheral afferent input dominates cerebellar thalamic discharge.},

  abstract = {Studies of lesions of the primate cerebellum leave little doubt that the cerebellum is necessary for the execution of smooth and accurate movements. How the cerebellum fulfills this role at a neuronal level remains unknown. It is likely that the cerebellum exerts the same effect on a number of different efferent targets. In order to influence voluntary movement, a major output from the cerebellum projects to the motor cortex via the cerebello-thalamo-cortical (CTC) pathway. By examining neuronal activity in the cerebellar thalamus, and comparing this with activity recorded from its connections with the deep cerebellar nuclei and motor cortex, conclusions can be made regarding cerebellar function. Current data does not support a role for the CTC pathway in the initiation of movement or the control of trans-cortical reflexes. Also, the evidence does not support the hypothesis that the cerebellum prevents terminal movement oscillations by predictively sending a message to the antagonist muscle to brake the movement. The available literature supports the Eccles theory that during normal movement, the CTC pathway receives a form of efference copy from the motor cortex and compares this message with that derived from peripheral afferents about the actual progress of the movement. However, there is not a significant degree of kinematic information passing through this pathway in the course of a voluntary movement. Therefore the actual site of comparison or error-detection in this system awaits further elucidation. ?? 1995.},

The location of electrophysiologically identified cerebellar-receiving (CR) and pallidal-receiving (PR) neurons was used to identify a total of 264 thalamic neurons in cerebellar (CB) or pallidal (GP) regions of the thalamus. 2. Stimulation in the brachium conjunctivum or white matter adjacent to the cerebellar nuclei excited 85 neurons in the thalamus at short latencies. These CR neurons were located in the oral portion of the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPLo), in caudal portions of the ventral lateral nucleus (VLc), and in area X. 3. Stimulation in the internal globus pallidus (GPi) inhibited 10 thalamic neurons at short latency. These PR neurons were located in rostral portions of VLc, in the oral part of the ventral lateral nucleus (VLo), and in the parvicellular part of the ventral anterior nucleus (VApc). 4. There was no clear single somatotopic organization of neurons in CB and GP regions of the thalamus, as defined by "free-form" responses to passive manipulation and observation of eye movements. There was, in fact, a tendency for two representations, each, of the head/eye/mouth cells and cells with modifications of activity in response to manipulation of the arm. 5. During the hold period before illumination of a visual target, the mean firing rates and variability of discharge of arm-related CR and PR neurons did not differ significantly. This was also true for the total sample of arm-related neurons in the CB versus GP regions. 6. The activity of many neurons in both the CB and GP regions began to change before the reaching movement and, for some, before the earliest recorded changes in electromyographic (EMG) activity. The initial change was an increase in discharge for greater than 75\% of the cells studied in both the CB and GP regions. 7. During the reaching task, there also was no significant difference in the time of the initial change in discharge of neurons in the CB versus GP regions of the thalamus. 8. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the initial task-related change in discharge of PR thalamic neurons is dominated by input from the cerebral cortex and that pallidal input modulates later phases of their movement-related changes in activity.},

This study examined them in nigro-thalamo-cortical pathways from the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) to the frontal cortex (FRC) via the mediodorsal (MD) and ventral anterior (VA) thalamus in monkeys. First, single thalamocortical neurons with SNr input were identified by antidromic responses to FRC stimulation and by inhibitory orthodromic responses with short latencies ({$<$}5 ms) to SNr stimulation. Second, single nigrothalamic neurons were found by antidromic responses to stimulation of the portions of the MD and VA where the thalamocortical neurons were recorded. The inhibitory orthodromic responses in the thalamocortical neurons were considered to be monosynaptically induced by nigral stimulation because the latency distribution of the orthodromic responses in the thalamocortical neurons was similar to that of the antidromic responses in the nigrothalamic neurons. Almost all relay neurons in the rostrolateral MD received inhibitory afferents from the caudolateral SNr and projected to the prefrontal area ventral to the principal sulcus, which constituted the densest nigro-thalamo-cortical projections. Meanwhile, neurons in the VA received inhibitory signals from the whole rostrocaudal extent of the SNr and projected to wide regions of the FRC; neurons in its pars magnocellularis mostly projected to different prefrontal areas, while those in its pars parvocellularis projected to motor areas. This report substantiated the topography of thalamocortical neurons monosynaptically receiving inhibitory SNr input and projecting to the FRC in the primate MD and VA at the single-neuron level.},

Here we investigated the role of the thalamostriatal pathway linking the parafascicular thalamus (Pf) with cholinergic interneurons (CINs) in the pDMS in this process. Removing the excitatory input from Pf to the CINs was found to reduce the firing rate and intrinsic activity of these neurons and produced an enduring deficit in goal-directed learning after changes in the action-outcome contingency. Disconnection of the Pf-pDMS pathway produced similar behavioral effects. These data suggest that CINs reduce interference between new and existing learning, consistent with claims that the thalamostriatal pathway exerts state control over learning-related plasticity},

  abstract = {The central theme of the "segregated circuits" hypothesis is that structural convergence and functional integration occurs within, rather than between, each of the identified circuits. Admittedly, the anatomical evidence upon which this scheme is based remains incomplete. The hypothesis continues to be predicated largely on comparisons of anterograde and retrograde labeling studies carried out in different sets of animals. Only in the case of the "motor" circuit has evidence for the continuity of the loop been demonstrated directly in individual subjects; for the other circuits, such continuity is inferred from comparisons of data on different components of each circuit obtained in separate experiments. Because of the marked compression of pathways leading from cortex through basal ganglia to thalamus, comparisons of projection topography across experimental subjects may be hazardous. Definitive tests of the hypothesis of maintained segregation await additional double- and multiple-label tract-tracing experiments wherein the continuity of one circuit, or the segregation of adjacent circuits, can be examined directly in individual subjects. It is worthy of note, however, that the few studies to date that have employed this methodology have generated results consistent with the segregated circuits hypothesis. Moreover, single cell recordings in behaving animals have shown striking preservation of functional specificity at the level of individual neurons throughout the "motor" and "oculomotor" circuits. It is difficult to imagine how such functional specificity could be maintained in the absence of strict topographic specificity within the sequential projections that comprise these two circuits. This is not to say, however, that we expect the internal structure of functional channels (e.g., the "arm" channel within the "motor" circuit) to have cable-like, point-to-point topography. When the grain of analysis is sufficiently fine, anatomical studies have shown repeatedly that the terminal fields of internuclear projections (e.g., to striatum, pallidum, nigra, thalamus, etc.) often appear patchy and highly divergent, suggesting that neighboring groups of projection cells tend to influence interdigitating clusters of postsynaptic neurons. While more intricate and complex than simple point-to-point topography, however, this type arrangement should also be capable of maintaining functional specificity. As discussed briefly above, it is not yet clear to what extent the inputs to the "motor" circuit from the different precentral motor fields (e.g., MC, SMA, APA) are integrated in their passage through the circuit. It now appears that at the level of the putamen such inputs remain segregated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

One of these, the anterior forebrain pathway, is necessary for the acquisition but not for the production of learned song in zebra finches. It has been shown that the anterior forebrain pathway sequentially connects the following nuclei: the high vocal center, area X of lobus parolfactorius, the medial portion of the dorsolateral thalamic nucleus, the lateral magnocellular nucleus of anterior neostriatum (IMAN), and the robust nucleus of the archistriatum (RA). We now show in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) that IMAN cells that project to RA also project to area X, forming a feedback loop within the anterior forebrain pathway. The axonal endings of the IMAN projection into area X form cohesive and distinct domains. Small injections of tracer in subregions of area X backfill a spatially restricted subset of cells in IMAN, that, in turn, send projections to RA that are arranged in horizontal layers, which may correspond to the functional representation of vocal tract muscles demonstrated by others. We infer from our data that there is a myotopic representation throughout the anterior forebrain pathway. In addition, we suggest that the parcellation of area X into smaller domains by the projection from IMAN highlights a functional architecture within X, which might correspond to units of motor control, to the representation of acoustic features of song, or both.},

  abstract = {In its simplest formulation, reinforcement learning is based on the idea that if an action taken in a particular context is followed by a favorable outcome, then, in the same context, the tendency to produce that action should be strengthened, or reinforced. While reinforcement learning forms the basis of many current theories of basal ganglia (BG) function, these models do not incorporate distinct computational roles for signals that convey context, and those that convey what action an animal takes. Recent experiments in the songbird suggest that vocal-related BG circuitry receives two functionally distinct excitatory inputs. One input is from a cortical region that carries context information about the current "time" in the motor sequence. The other is an efference copy of motor commands from a separate cortical brain region that generates vocal variability during learning. Based on these findings, I propose here a general model of vertebrate BG function that combines context information with a distinct motor efference copy signal. The signals are integrated by a learning rule in which efference copy inputs gate the potentiation of context inputs (but not efference copy inputs) onto medium spiny neurons in response to a rewarded action. The hypothesis is described in terms of a circuit that implements the learning of visually guided saccades. The model makes testable predictions about the anatomical and functional properties of hypothesized context and efference copy inputs to the striatum from both thalamic and cortical sources.},

The large neurons (40-50 mum) tend to be located dorsomedially and ventrolaterally at more caudal nuclear levels, while the small- and medium-sized neurons (15-35 mum) predominate at rostral levels. However, neurons of all sizes are present throughout the nucleus. Following lesions of the nucleus, the course of degenerating axons stained with the Fink-Heimer method has been traced throughout the brainstem and spinal cord. The rubrospinal tract crosses the midline, courses past the ventrocaudal aspect of the contralateral nucleus ruber, and then descends rostro-ventral and lateral to the nucleus tegmenti pontinus. In its caudal continuation the tract lies ventral to the brachium conjunctivum and the entering radix of the trigeminal nerve. It then assumes a ventrolateral position in the caudal brainstem before shifting to a dorsolateral position in the lateral funiculus of the spinal cord. Within the spinal grey the rubrospinal tract terminates in laminae V, VI and to a lesser extent VII. The possibility of a topographical organization of the nucleus was investigated with injections of horseradish peroxidase into brachial, thoracic and lumbar spinal cord.

A crossed rubrospinal tract occurs in anurans, limbed urodeles and reptiles, birds and mammals, but is apparently absent in boid snakes, caecilians and sharks. A distinct rubrospinal tract is found in certain rays which use their enlarged pectoral fins for locomotion. A crossed tegmentospinal tract, possibly a rubrospinal tract, is found in lungfishes. Although evidence was presented for a rubrospinal tract in more advanced snakes, the available experimental data in lower vertebrates suggest that the presence of a rubrospinal tract is related to the presence of limbs or limb-like structures. In the connectivity of the red nucleus in terrestrial vertebrates, 'levels' of complexity can be distinguished, paralleled by the development of the cerebellum. These 'grades of organization' are probably related to the type of motor performance the particular terrestrial vertebrates are capable of. ?? 1988.},

Approximately 90\% of the corticorubral projection is directed to the parvocellular division of the nucleus. Corticoparvocellular (CRp) neurons are pyramidally shaped, are smaller in size than corticospinal neurons, and are more numerous. They are found principally in sublamina Va of cytoarchitectonic areas 4 and 6, and in moderate quantities in sublamina Vb of posterior area 8 and area 5. In areas 4 and 6, the cells are grouped in clusters of three to 15 neurons each and are arranged in cellular bands of varying rostrocaudal thickness which course mediolaterally. With respect to functionally defined zones, CRp neurons are found throughout the supplementary motor area and the precentral motor cortex. In addition, they are found in parts of areas 5, 6, and 24 that project to these cortical motor areas, and that are thought to have "premotor" or movement-programming functions. The corticomagnocellular (CRm) projection arises principally from cells in sublamina Vb of the precentral arm and leg areas (area 4), and from adjacent parts of posterior area 6, CRm cells are pyramidally shaped, and their size distribution is bimodal, with peaks that correspond, respectively, to the modal diameters of CRp and of corticospinal neurons. These results and those of previous studies suggest that CRm neurons are involved principally in the control of hand and foot movements, with little effect on more proximal musculature. The massive CRp projection, however, is clearly part of a large cerebrocerebellar communication system, with motor and/or movement programming functions that have yet to be clearly defined.},

The brainstem terminations of fibers arising in the dentate and interposed nuclei are similar. Both cerebellofugal systems follow similar intracerebellar trajectories, leave the cerebellum via the brachium conjunctivum, decussate and distribute terminal ramifications contralaterally in the red nucleus, the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis and the inferior olivary complex. Although the zones innervated by the dentate and interposed nuclei are similar within the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis, these two deep cerebellar nuclei project differentially to the red nucleus, and to the inferior olivary complex. The dentate nucleus projects only to the parvocellular red nucleus and the principal olivary nucleus, whereas the interposed nucleus projects only to the magnocellular red nucleus and the two accessory olivary nuclei. No terminations were detected in the oculomotor nuclei following injections into the dentate nucleus. The fastigial projections to the brainstem are extensive, bilateral, and independent of the dentatofugal and interpositofugal systems. The majority of the fastigio-brainstem fibers decussate within the cerebellum, then leave the cerebellum via the uncinate fasciculus. Contralaterally, the fastigio-brainstem projections terminate in the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis, Deiter's nucleus, portions of the descending vestibular nucleus, the pontine nuclei, the pontine raphe, and parts of the reticular formation from the midbrain caudally. The fastigial projection to the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis terminates in a zone clearly independent of the dentate and interpositus projections. The ipsilateral fastigio-brainstem terminations are less extensvie than the contralateral. They occur in Deiter's nucleus, in portions of the descending vestibular nucleus, and at the rostralmost end of the mesencephalic reticular formation near the pretectal area. The terminations of fibers projecting from the dorsal column nuclei to the inferior olivary complex occur in zones which are coextensive with cerebellar termination zones. Both the fibers of the dorsal column nuclei and of the anterior interposed nucleus terminate in the dorsal accessory olive. Other than the dorsal accessory olive, the only other brainstem projection from the dorsal column nuclei is to the external nucleus of the inferior colliculus. Projections to the spinal cord arise in the interposed and fastigial nuclei. The interpositospinal projection leaves the cerebellum via the ipsilateral brachium conjunctivum, decussates, travels in the ventral funiculus of the spinal cord, and terminates on interneurons in the intermediate zone. By contrast, the fastigiospinal projection decussates within the cerebellum, leaves the cerebellum via the contralateral uncinate fasciculus, travels in the lateral funiculus, and terminates around motoneurons in the ventral horn. No spinal projections were detected from the dentate nucleus. ?? 1983.},

  abstract = {Motor thalamic nuclei, ventral anterior (VA), ventral lateral (VL) and ventral medial (VM) nuclei, receive massive glutamatergic and GABAergic afferents from the cerebellum and basal ganglia, respectively. In the present study, these afferents were characterized with immunoreactivities for glutamic acid decarboxylase of 67 kDa (GAD67) and vesicular glutamate transporter (VGluT)2, and examined by combining immunocytochemistry with the anterograde axonal labeling and neuronal depletion methods in the rat brain. VGluT2 immunoreactivity was intense in the caudodorsal portion of the VA-VL, whereas GAD67 immunoreactivity was abundant in the VM and rostroventral portion of the VA-VL. The rostroventral VA-VL and VM contained two types of GAD67-immunopositive varicosities (large and small), but the caudodorsal VA-VL comprised small ones alone. VGluT2-immunopositive varicosities were much larger in the caudodorsal VA-VL than those in the rostroventral VA-VL and VM. When anterograde tracers were injected into the basal ganglia output nuclei, the vast majority of labeled axon varicosities were large and distributed in the rostroventral VA-VL and VM, showing immunoreactivity for GAD67, but not for VGluT2. Only the large GAD67-immunopositive varicosities were mostly abolished by kainic acid depletion of substantia nigra neurons. In contrast, large to giant axon varicosities derived from the deep cerebellar nuclei were distributed mostly in the caudodorsal VA-VL, displaying VGluT2 immunoreactivity. The VGluT2-positive varicosities disappeared from the core portion of the caudodorsal VA-VL by depletion of cerebellar nucleus neurons. Thus, complementary distributions of large VGluT2- and GAD67-positive terminals in the motor thalamic nuclei are considered to reflect glutamatergic cerebellar and GABAergic basal ganglia afferents, respectively.},

  abstract = {The pontine nuclei (PN) and the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis (NRTP) are sources of an excitatory projection to the cerebellar cortex via mossy fibers and a direct excitatory projection to the cerebellar nuclei. These precerebellar nuclei, in turn, receive a feedback projection from the cerebellar nuclei, which mostly originate in the lateral nucleus (LN). It has been suggested that the feedback projection from the LN partially uses gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as a transmitter. We tested this hypothesis by using a combination of anterograde tracing (biotinylated dextran amine injection into the LN) and postembedding GABA and glutamate immunogold histochemistry. The pattern of labeling in the PN and the NRTP was compared with that of cerebellonuclear terminals in two other target structures, the parvocellular part of the nucleus ruber (RNp) and the ventromedial and ventrolateral thalamus (VM/VL). The projection to the inferior olive (IO), which is known to be predominantly GABAergic, served as a control. A quantitative analysis of the synaptic terminals labeled by the tracer within the PN, the NRTP, and the VL/VM revealed no GABA immunoreactivity. Only one clearly labeled terminal was found in the RNp. In contrast, 72\% of the terminals in the IO were clearly GABA immunoreactive, confirming the reliability of our staining protocol. Correspondingly, glutamate immunohistochemistry labeled the majority of the cerebellonuclear terminals in the PN (88\%), the NRTP (90\%), the RNp (93\%), and the VM/VL (63\%) but labeled only 5\% in the IO. These data do not support a role for GABAergic inhibition either in the feedback systems from the LN to the PN and the NRTP or within the projections to the RNp and the VM/VL.},

We first divided the ventral anterior-ventral lateral motor thalamic nuclei into 1) the rostromedial portion, which was designated inhibitory afferent-dominant zone (IZ) with intense glutamate decarboxylase immunoreactivity and weak vesicular glutamate transporter 2 immunoreactivity, and 2) the caudolateral portion, named excitatory subcortical afferent-dominant zone (EZ) with the reversed immunoreactivity profile. We then labeled 38 motor thalamic neurons in 29 hemispheres by injecting a diluted palGFP-Sindbis virus solution and isolated 10 IZ and EZ neurons for reconstruction. All the reconstructed IZ neurons widely projected not only to the cerebral cortex but also to the neostriatum, whereas the EZ neurons sent axons almost exclusively to the cortex. More interestingly, 47-66\% of axon varicosities of IZ neurons were observed in layer I of cortical areas. In contrast, only 2-15\% of varicosities of EZ neurons were found in layer I, most varicosities being located in middle layers.

  abstract = {Birdsong provides a unique model for understanding the behavioral and neural bases underlying complex sequential behaviors. However, birdsong analyses require laborious effort to make the data quantitatively analyzable. The previous attempts had succeeded to provide some reduction of human efforts involved in birdsong segment classification. The present study was aimed to further reduce human efforts while increasing classification performance. In the current proposal, a linear-kernel support vector machine was employed to minimize the amount of human-generated label samples for reliable element classification in birdsong, and to enable the classifier to handle highly-dimensional acoustic features while avoiding the over-fitting problem. Bengalese finch's songs in which distinct elements (i.e., syllables) were aligned in a complex sequential pattern were used as a representative test case in the neuroscientific research field. Three evaluations were performed to test (1) algorithm validity and accuracy with exploring appropriate classifier settings, (2) capability to provide accuracy with reducing amount of instruction dataset, and (3) capability in classifying large dataset with minimized manual labeling. The results from the evaluation (1) showed that the algorithm is 99.5\% reliable in song syllables classification. This accuracy was indeed maintained in evaluation (2), even when the instruction data classified by human were reduced to one-minute excerpt (corresponding to 300-400 syllables) for classifying two-minute excerpt. The reliability remained comparable, 98.7\% accuracy, when a large target dataset of whole day recordings ({$\sim$}30,000 syllables) was used. Use of a linear-kernel support vector machine showed sufficient accuracies with minimized manually generated instruction data in bird song element classification. The methodology proposed would help reducing laborious processes in birdsong analysis without sacrificing reliability, and therefore can help accelerating behavior and studies using songbirds.},

  abstract = {There is increasing evidence that, in addition to its major functional role in the regulation of fine motor control, the cerebellum is involved in other important functions, such as sensory-motor learning and memory. Classical conditioning of the eyeblink or nictitating membrane response (and other discrete behavioral responses) is a form of sensory-motor learning that depends crucially upon the cerebellum. Within the cerebellum, however, the relative importance of the cerebellar cortex and the deep cerebellar nuclei in eyeblink conditioning is unclear and disputed. Recent studies employing various mutant mice provide an effective approach to resolving this controversy. Eyeblink conditioning in spontaneous mutant mice deficient in Purkinje cells, the exclusive output neurons of the cerebellar cortex, indicate that both the cerebellar cortex and the interpositus nucleus are important. Furthermore, studies involving gene knockout mice suggest that long-term depression, a process of synaptic plasticity occurring in Purkinje cells, might be involved in eyeblink conditioning.},

Delay eyeblink conditioning depends on the intermediate cerebellum ipsilateral to the conditioned eye. Evidence favors a two-site plasticity model within the cerebellum with long-term depression of parallel fiber synapses on Purkinje cells and long-term potentiation of mossy fiber synapses on neurons in the anterior interpositus nucleus. Conditioned stimulus and unconditioned stimulus inputs arise from the pontine nuclei and inferior olive, respectively, converging in the cerebellar cortex and deep nuclei. Projections from subcortical sensory nuclei to the pontine nuclei that are necessary for eyeblink conditioning are beginning to be identified, and recent studies indicate that there are dynamic interactions between sensory thalamic nuclei and the cerebellum during eyeblink conditioning. Cerebellar output is projected to the magnocellular red nucleus and then to the motor nuclei that generate the blink response(s). Tremendous progress has been made toward determining the neural mechanisms of delay eyeblink conditioning but there are still significant gaps in our understanding of the necessary neural circuitry and plasticity mechanisms underlying cerebellar learning.},

This paper considers the cerebellum in relation to neurocognitive development, language function, working memory, executive function, and the development of cerebellar internal control models and reflects upon some of the ways in which better understanding the cerebellum's status as a ``supervised learning machine'' can enrich our ability to understand human function and adaptation. As all contributors agree that the cerebellum plays a role in cognition, there is also an agreement that this conclusion remains highly inferential. Many conclusions about the role of the cerebellum in cognition originate from applying known information about cerebellar contributions to the coordination and quality of movement. These inferences are based on the uniformity of the cerebellum's compositional infrastructure and its apparent modular organization. There is considerable support for this view, based upon observations of patients with pathology within the cerebellum.},

A close interplay between three main strands of contemporary neuroscience induced a substantial modification of the traditional view of the cerebellum as a mere coordinator of autonomic and somatic motor functions. Indeed, the wealth of current evidence derived from detailed neuroanatomical investigations, functional neuroimaging studies with healthy subjects and patients and in-depth neuropsychological assessment of patients with cerebellar disorders shows that the cerebellum has a cardinal role to play in affective regulation, cognitive processing, and linguistic function. Although considerable progress has been made in models of cerebellar function, controversy remains regarding the exact role of the "linguistic cerebellum" in a broad variety of nonmotor language processes. This consensus paper brings together a range of different viewpoints and opinions regarding the contribution of the cerebellum to language function. Recent developments and insights in the nonmotor modulatory role of the cerebellum in language and some related disorders will be discussed. The role of the cerebellum in speech and language perception, in motor speech planning including apraxia of speech, in verbal working memory, in phonological and semantic verbal fluency, in syntax processing, in the dynamics of language production, in reading and in writing will be addressed. In addition, the functional topography of the linguistic cerebellum and the contribution of the deep nuclei to linguistic function will be briefly discussed.

The present study has further detailed the anatomical organization of the afferent and efferent connections of SpL, with particular reference to (1) the sources of afferent inputs to SpL, (2) the projection targets of SpL, and (3) the laminar termination pattern of the SpL projection to the tectum. The SpL was found to receive clear-cut major inputs from only three nuclei: (1) the ipsilateral paleostriatum primitivum (PP) of the basal ganglia (the avian homologue of the mammalian globus pallidus), (2) the ipsilateral anterior nucleus of the ansa lenticularis (ALa) of the diencephalon, and (3) the ipsilateral nucleus tegmentipedunculopontinus (TPc) of the mesencephalon. Both TPc and ALa have previously been noted themselves to receive major inputs from the ipsilateral PP (Karten and Dubbeldam, '73). Two other cell groups may give rise to a slight projection to the ipsilateral SpL: (1) the posterior nucleus of the ansa lenticularis (ALp) of the diencephalon and (2) the nucleus semilunaris (SLu) of the isthmic brainstem. The ALp also receives a major input from PP (Karten and Dubbeldam, '73). Two other cell groups may give rise to a slight projection to the ipsilateral SpL: (1) the posterior nucleus of the ansa lenticularis (ALp) of the diencephalon and (2) the nucleus semilunaris (SLu) of the isthmic brainstem. The ALp also receives a major input from PP (Karten and Dubbeldam, '73), while SLu receives a major tectal projection (Hunt and Kunzle, '76a). The ipsilateral tectum was found to be the only projection target of SpL. The present data suggest that the SpL projection to the tectum is restricted to layers 8-13, with layers 11-13 receiving the heaviest projection from SpL. Among layers 8-10, layer 9 receives the lightest projection from SpL. The present results indicate that SpL receives only a limited number of inputs, which in all likelihood relay largely basal ganglia input to SpL. Since SpL projects only to the tectum, the sole function of SpL apparently is the transmission of ipsilateral basal ganglia influences to the avian optic tectum. Tectal layers 8-15 have been previously found to represent the layers of origin of the descending pathways of the avian tectum to hindbrain motor and "premotor" cell groups (Reiner and Karten, '82). In view of the purported involvement of the basal ganglia in motor functions, the basal ganglia pathway to the ipsilateral tectum via SpL may represent a major route by which the avian basal ganglia exert influences over motor functions.},

Small injections placed into the reticular, ventral, laterodorsal, lateroposterior, posterior, mediodorsal, geniculate, and intralaminar nuclei resulted in several distinct patterns of retrograde labelling. As expected, the appropriate specific sensory and motor-related subcortical structures were retrogradely labelled after injections into the principal thalamic nuclei. In addition, other basal forebrain and brainstem structures were also labelled, with their distribution dependent on the site of injection. A large percentage of these latter projections was cholinergic. In the brainstem, the cholinergic pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus was retrogradely labelled after all thalamic injections, suggesting that it provides a widespread innervation to the thalamus. Neurons of the cholinergic laterodorsal tegmental nucleus were retrogradely labelled after injections into the anterior, laterodorsal, central medial, and mediodorsal nuclei, suggesting that it provides a projection to limbic components of the thalamus. Significant basal forebrain labelling occurred only with injections into the reticular and mediodorsal nuclei. Only injections into the reticular nucleus resulted in retrograde labelling of the cholinergic neurons in the nucleus basalis of Meynert. The results provide evidence for an organized system of thalamic afferents arising from cholinergic and noncholinergic structures in the brainstem and basal forebrain. The brainstem structures, especially the cholinergic pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, appear to project directly to principal thalamic nuclei, thereby providing a possible anatomical substrate for mediating the well-known facilitory effects of brainstem stimulation upon thalamocortical transmission.},

This report focuses on STT input to the ventral lateral nucleus (VL), where prior anterograde tracing studies identified dense or moderately dense STT terminations. Large and very large injections in VL produced large numbers of labeled cells predominantly in laminae V and VII (more than half as many as from massive injections in the entire thalamus). Medium-sized and small injections in VL labeled STT cells almost exclusively in laminae V and VII, in segments consistent with the coarse mediolateral VL topography; few or no cells were labeled in lamina I. All injections labeled the deep cerebellar nuclei (see accompanying article: Evrard and Craig, 2008). Notably, even the most anterior injection in VL that produced dense pallidal labeling still labeled both STT and deep cerebellar cells. These observations indicate that VL receives STT input originating from laminae V and VII neurons that may be coextensive with its cerebellothalamic input. These findings support the role of laminae V and VII STT cells in sensorimotor integration and suggest a significant ongoing influence on both motor and premotor thalamocortical function. Together with the preceding observations of selective STT projections to other thalamic regions, these results provide compelling evidence that the primate STT consists of anatomically and functionally differentiable components.},

We have designated this latter zone "intermediate geniculate," distinguishing a somatosensory portion of the geniculate group on the basis of its myelo- and cytoarchitecture, as well as its connections.

There are grounds for believing that sensory information may reach VPLo via the dorsal column nuclei. We set out to test this hypothesis using neuroanatomical tracing methods. 2. Injections of tritiated amino acids into the dorsal column nuclei did not lead to autoradiographic labeling of terminal ramifications in nucleus VPLo, but such labeling was present in nucleus ventralis posterior lateralis pars caudalis (VPLc). 3. Small injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were made into VPLo or into adjacent nuclei. The sites of injection were determined from the distribution of short-latency field potentials evoked by electrically stimulating the contralteral median and ulnar nerves. Injections into VPLo and VLc led to retrograde labeling of cells in the deep cerebellar nuclei, but not in the dorsal column nuclei. For reasons discussed in the text, it is unlikely that the cerebellar nuclei relay sensory information at short latency to the thalamus and motor cortex. Injections of HRP into VPLo also led to labeling of cells in several laminae of the spinal cord. 4. Cells of the cuneate and external cuneate nuclei, including presumed group I muscle afferent relay, were labeled only when injections spread into VPLc. Such injections were also accompanied by retrograde labeling of cells in the vestibular nuclei. 5. HRP injections of VPLo retrogradely labeled corticothalamic cells only in area 4; injections of VPLc labeled corticothalamic cells in areas 3, 1, and 2 of sensory cortex. Injections at the border between VPLo and VPLc did not preferentially label corticothalamic cells in area 3a of the cortex. There is no evidence from this finding or from other studies for a separate anatomically distinct thalamic relay to an area 3a. 6.

  abstract = {This study examines the organization of thalamostriatal projections from ventral tier nuclei that relay basal ganglia output to the frontal cortex. Although previous thalamostriatal studies emphasize projections from the intralaminar nuclei, studies in primates show a substantial projection from the ventral anterior (VA) and ventral lateral (VL) nuclei. These nuclei make up the main efferent projection from the basal ganglia to frontal cortical areas, including primary motor, supplementary, premotor, and cingulate motor areas. Functionally related motor areas of the frontal cortex and VA/VL have convergent projections to specific regions of the dorsal striatum. The distribution of VA/VL terminals within the striatum is crucial to understanding their relationship to motor cortical afferents. We placed anterograde tracer injections into discrete VA/VL thalamic areas. VA/VL thalamostriatal projections terminate in broad, rostrocaudal regions of the dorsal striatum, corresponding to regions innervated by functionally related cortical motor areas. The pars oralis division of VL projects primarily to the dorsolateral, postcommissural putamen, whereas the parvicellular VA targets more medial and rostral putamen regions, and the magnocellular division of VA targets the dorsal head of the caudate nucleus. Whereas these results demonstrate a general functional topography, specific VA/VL projections overlap extensively, suggesting that functionally distinct VA/VL projections may also converge in dorsal striatal areas. Within striatal territories, VA/VL projections terminate in a patchy, nonhomogeneous manner, indicating another level of complexity. Moreover, terminal fields contain both terminal clusters and scattered, long, unbranched fibers with many varicosities. These fiber morphologies resemble those from the cortex and raise the possibility that VA/VL thalamostriatal projections neurons have divergent connectional features.},

In rats injections of {$<$} 1.0??l of a gold-wheatgerm agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase complex were restricted to the centrum medianum, centralis lateralis, medialis dorsalis, zona incerta, ventrobasal thalamic complex, or medial or lateral hypothalamus. Injections in the centralis lateralis, with some involvement of centrum medianum and medial medialis dorsalis, labeled numerous neurons throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the midbrain periaqueductal gray, and adjacent reticular formation, dorsal raphe nucleus and substantia nigra. These labeled neurons were distributed bilaterally, but with a preponderance ipsilaterally. Numerous neurons in the deep layers of the ipsilateral superior colliculus and in the anterior pretectal nucleus were also labeled. Many neurons in the pontomedullary raphe nuclei (including nucleus raphe magnus), locus coeruleus and dorsolateral parabrachial nuclei, and in the pontomedullary reticular formation, were labeled bilaterally. Fewer were seen bilaterally in the lateral reticular nucleus and nucleus of the solitary tract, with relatively few in the dorsal aspect of the trigeminal nucleus caudalis. Injections restricted largely to the centrum medianum labeled fewer cells in the brainstem, but with similar distributions. An injection restricted to the centralis lateralis also resulted in a similar distribution of labeled neurons in midbrain and nucleus raphe magnus but did not label neurons at more caudal medullary levels. An injection restricted to zona incerta labeled numerous neurons in a distribution similar to that following medial thalamic injections, except that many more were observed in the contralateral sensory trigeminal nucleus and in the dorsal column nuclei. Injections of the ventrobasal thalamic nucleus labeled many neurons in the trigeminal and dorsal column nuclei, but many fewer neurons in the midbrain, periaqueductal gray and reticular formation compared with medial thalamic injections. Labeled neurons were also seen in the superior and inferior colliculi, due presumably to involvement by the injection of the lateral posterior and magnocellular medial geniculate nuclei, respectively. Injections in the lateral hypothalamus labeled numerous neurons in a distribution similar to that seen following medial thalamic injections. A restricted medial hypothalamus injection labeled neurons in a pattern similar to that seen with lateral hypothalamus injections. A very restricted, caudal injection in the premammillary region labeled a small number of cells scattered throughout ventral periaqueductal gray, but revealed a strikingly dense, bilateral projection from the ventral and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei (Gudden) in the caudal midbrain. These results largely confirm the origins of brainstem projections to the diencephalon as delineated previously, and additionally reveal larger numbers of labeled neurons compared with some previous studies using other retrograde tracers. The relationship of these brainstem areas to mechanisms of pain and analgesia is emphasized. ?? 1990.},

All major sensory (medial geniculate. lateral geniculate, ventrobasal). motor (venlroanterior. ventrolateral. ventromedial), associational (mediodorsal, pulvinar, lateral posterior) and limbic (anteromedial.,interoventral) thalamic nuclei of the cat were found to receive projections from cholinergic neurons located in the peribrachial area of the pedunculopontine nucleus and in the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus as well as from non-cholinergic neurons in the rostral (perirubral) part of the central tegmental mesencephalic field. Specific relay nuclei receive less than 10\%) of their brainstem afferents from non-cholinergic neurons located at rostral midbrain levels and receive 85 96\% of their brainstem innervation from a region at midbrain pontinc junction where the cholinergic perihrachial area and laterodorsal tegmental nucleus are maximally developed. of the total number of horseradish peroxidase-positive brainstem neurons seen after injections in various specific relay nuclei, the double-labeled (horseradish peroxidase + choline acetyltransferase) neurons represent approximately 70 85\%. Three to eight times more numerous horseradish peroxidase-labeled brainstem cells were found after injections in associational (mediodorsal and pulvinar lateral posterior complex) and diffusely cortically projecting (ventromedial) thalamic nuclei of cat than after injections in specific relay nuclei. The striking retrograde cell labeling observed after injections in nuclei with associative functions and widespread cortical projections was due to massive afferentation from non-cholinergic parts of the midbrain and pontine reticular formation, on both ipsi- and contralateral sides. After wheat germ agglutinin horseradish peroxidase injections in the associative pulvinar lateral posterior complex and mediodorsal nucleus of Macaca sylvana.. 45 50\% of horseradish peroxidase-positive brainstem peribrachial neurons were also choline acetyltransferase-positive. While cells in the medial part of the cholinergic peribrachial area were found to project especially towards the pulvinar lateral posterior nuclear complex in monkey, the retrograde cell labeling seen after the mediodorsal injection was mostly confined to the lateral part of both dorsal and ventral aspects of the peribrachial area. These findings support the role played by cholinergic and non-cholinergic hrainstem thalamic projections in various tonic and phasic events of behavioral slates of vigilance. ?? 1988.},

Following tritiated amino acid injections into the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and WGA-HRP injections into the contralateral cerebellar nuclei, we found that the nigrothalamic and cerebellothalamic afferents distribute to three main targets: the central portion of the ventral anterior nucleus (VA) and the ventral lateral nucleus (VL), the internal medullary lamina (IML) region, which includes the paralaminar VA, the mediodorsal nucleus (MD) and the central lateral nucleus (CL), and finally the ventromedial nucleus (VM). We observed three distribution patterns of labeled fibers: a) Dense single label was observed in the central portion of VA following the SNr injections and in VL following the cerebellar nuclei injections. b) A complementary pattern consisting of alternating foci of nigral and cerebellar label was found in the IML region. This pattern was also observed in the caudal intralaminar nuclei where cerebellar label predominated in the centrum medianum (CM), while the parafascicular nucleus (Pf) primarily contained nigral label. c) An overlapping pattern of autoradiographic and WGA-HRP label was found in the lateral half of the VM. Overall, the distribution of nigrothalamic and cerebellothalamic projections was widespread throughout much of rostrocaudal thalamus. However, the pattern of projections varied along a continuum from lateral to medial thalamus. In lateral thalamus, nigral and cerebellar projections distributed to separate nuclei while in medial thalamus, the projection pattern changed to focal and complementary in the IML and overlapping in VM. Taken together, these thalamic projections may constitute crucial links in different functional channels involved in alerting and orienting mechanisms associated with motor behavior. Our findings also suggest that the organization of motor thalamic afferents in the dog shares similarities with the segregated and parallel circuitry characteristic of primates as well as with the overlapping and converging circuits of rodents and other carnivores.},

The identified sites of cholinergic and/or cholinoceptive neurons are similar to the cholinergic presence in vocal control regions of other songbirds such as the song sparrow, starling and another genus of the zebra finch (Poephila guttata), and to a certain extent in parallel vocal control regions in vocalizing birds such as the budgerigar. AChE presence in the vocal control system suggests innervation by either afferent projecting cholinergic systems and/or local circuit cholinergic neurons. Co-occurrence with choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) indicates efferent cholinergic projections. The cholinergic presence in parts of the zebra finch vocal control system, such as the area X, that is also intricately wired with parts of the basal ganglia, the descending fibre tracts and brain stem nuclei could underlie this circuitry's involvement in sensory processing and motor control of song},

  abstract = {To understand the principles of operation of the striatum it is critical to elucidate the properties of the main excitatory inputs from cortex and thalamus, as well as their ability to activate the main neurons of the striatum, the medium spiny neurons (MSNs). As the thalamostriatal projection is heterogeneous, we set out to isolate and study the thalamic afferent inputs to MSNs using small localized injections of adeno-associated virus carrying fusion genes for channelrhodopsin-2 and YFP, in either the rostral or caudal regions of the intralaminar thalamic nuclei (i.e. the central lateral or parafascicular nucleus). This enabled optical activation of specific thalamic afferents combined with whole-cell, patch-clamp recordings of MSNs and electrical stimulation of cortical afferents, in adult mice. We found that thalamostriatal synapses differ significantly in their peak amplitude responses, short-term dynamics and expression of ionotropic glutamate receptor subtypes. Our results suggest that central lateral synapses are most efficient in driving MSNs to depolarization, particularly those of the direct pathway, as they exhibit large amplitude responses, short-term facilitation and predominantly express postsynaptic AMPA receptors. In contrast, parafascicular synapses exhibit small amplitude responses, short-term depression and predominantly express postsynaptic NMDA receptors, suggesting a modulatory role, e.g. facilitating Ca(2+)-dependent processes. Indeed, pairing parafascicular, but not central lateral, presynaptic stimulation with action potentials in MSNs, leads to NMDA receptor- and Ca(2+)-dependent long-term depression at these synapses. We conclude that the main excitatory thalamostriatal afferents differ in many of their characteristics and suggest that they each contribute differentially to striatal information processing.},

The thalamic termination zones for the dentate, interposed and fastigial nuclei are identical and coincide with the cytoarchitectonically unique cell-sparse region of the ventral lateral complex. This region includes nuclei VPLo, VLc, VLps, X64 and extensions of these between the cell clusters of nucleus VLo. The inputs from dentate and interpositus are contralateral dense, and their termination patterns extend continuously throughout all nuclear components of the cell-sparse zone. Interdigitation of these two inputs within the cell-sparse region is directly demonstrated The fastigial input is more restricted but bilateral. Each of the deep cerebellar nuclei also projects to the central lateral nucleus of the intralaminar complex. The strong interconnection of the cell-sparse zone with cortical area 4 is confirmed. The patterns of retrogradely labeled thalamocortical cells and of anterogradely labeled corticothalamic terminations following cortical injections of horseradish peroxidase and of tritiated amino acids, extend continuously through the VPLo-VLc region and its extensions but do not invade the posteriorly situated VPLc nucleus. Thalamic inputs from the dorsal column nuclei terminate independently within the morphologically distinct VPLc nucleus adjacent to the cell-sparse cerebellar terminal zone. The dorsal column-lemniscal terminations do not overlap the cerebellar terminations The clear segregation of the two sets of terminations is demonstrated directly using an anterograde double labeling method. Spinothalamic terminations end in VPLc but extend into the cerebellar terminal zone. Another ascending input, from the vestibular nuclei, is also shown to terminate within the cell-sparse zone. Comparison with other studies implies that cerebellar pallidal and substantia nigral inputs do not converge in the monkey thalamus and that the nuclei in which they terminate project to different cortical areas. The relation of these and of sensory influences ascending to motor cortex from the periphery are discussed. ?? 1983.},

Cells of the central lateral nucleus have a morphology that conforms to the classic descriptions of the bushy cells which represent the main neuronal type of most thalamic nuclei. They display many short radiating dendrites studded with sessile spines, protrusions and grapelike appendages. The total extent of their dendritic fields is about 250 mu m. After leaving the nucleus, all central lateral axons course through the rostrolateral pole of the thalamic reticular nucleus, where they branch profusely, enter the striatum, where they distribute collaterals, and arborize in the motor cortex. At striatal level, central lateral fibers form a loosely organized network composed of varicose axonal branches that appear to contact en passant several striatal neurons. In the cortex. central lateral axons from multiple (four to five patches of terminations in layers Va and III aligned along the rostrocaudal extent of the motor area. The projection to layers I and II is very sparse, consisting of occasional branches which show few ramifications. Our results indicate that most, and perhaps all, central lateral relay neurons project to both the striatum and cerebral cortex. The patchy innervation of mid cortical layers of the frontal motor areas by central lateral afferents strongly argues against the nonspecific character of this projection. It is proposed that the central lateral nucleus, which receives a strong innervation from brainstem cholinergic afferents, takes part in a mechanism of attention related to the central initiation of directed patterns of movements},

Efferent fibres from both nuclei project predominantly to areas of the thalamus, which in turn project to the motor cortex. In this study, single and double anterograde-tracing techniques have been used to examine and compare the pathways from the lateral and interposed nuclei to the thalamus in the rat by using both light and electron microscopy to look for evidence of organisational or structural features that may underlie the proposed functional differences between these nuclei. Terminals from the lateral nucleus were found to be located most medially in the thalamus, predominantly in the ventral lateral nucleus and the rostral pole of the posterior nuclear group. Terminals from the posterior interposed nucleus were located slightly rostral and lateral to those from the lateral nucleus, mainly around the border between the ventral lateral nucleus and the ventral posterior medial nucleus. Terminals from the anterior interposed nucleus were located slightly rostral and lateral to those from the posterior interposed nucleus, predominantly in the rostral pole of the ventral posterior lateral nucleus. Terminals from the lateral and interposed nuclei were also found in double anterograde-tracing experiments to be nonoverlapping in the regions between these main areas of termination. The structure of terminals from the lateral and interposed nuclei, however, as well as their synaptic relationship with thalamic neurones, were found to be similar. The terminals are large and form synapses with proximal dendrites of thalamic neurones. They contained round vesicles and formed multiple synaptic contacts with dendritic shafts, as well as dendritic spines. The findings indicate that information from the lateral and interposed nuclei is processed in separate regions of the thalamus but that the mode of synaptic transfer to thalamic neurones is likely to be similar for the two projections.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine the topographical organization of cerebellothalamic projections in the rat. Following stereotaxic injections of 3H-leucine or electrolytic lesions in the cerebellar nuclei, efferent fibers were observed to emerge from the cerebellum through two discrete routes. Fibers from the fastigial nucleus decussated within the cerebellum, formed the crossed ascending limb of the uncinate fasciculus, ascended in the dorsal part of the midbrain tegmentum, and entered the thalamus. Cerebellothalamic fibers from the interpositus and dentate nuclei coursed in the ipsilateral brachium conjunctivum, decussated in the caudal midbrain, and ascended to the thalamus via the crossed ascending limb of the brachium conjunctivum. Cerebellar terminations were observed in the intralaminar, lateral, and ventral tier thalamic nuclei as well as in the medial dorsal nucleus. Projections to the intralaminar nuclei were more pronounced from the dentate and posterior interpositus than from the anterior interpositus and fastigial nuclei. The lateral thalamic nuclei received a projection from the dentate and posterior interpositus nuclei while the fastigial nucleus projected to the medial dorsal nucleus. Within the rostral ventral tier nuclei fastigiothalamic terminations were localized in the medial parts of the ventral medial and ventral lateral nuclei, whereas dentatothalamic projections were concentrated in the lateral parts of the ventral medial nucleus and the medial half of the ventral lateral nucleus. Terminations from the posterior interpositus nucleus were observed ventrally and laterally within the caudal two-thirds of the ventral medial nucleus and throughout the ventral lateral nucleus, where they were densest in the lateral part of its lateral wing and within the central part of its cap. The anterior interpositus nucleus also projected to the central and lateral parts of the ventral lateral nucleus, but these terminations were considerably less dense than those from the posterior interpositus. A few fibers from the interpositus nuclei terminated in the medial part of the rostral pole of the ventral posterior nucleus. A prominent recrossing of cerebellothalamic fibers from the fastigial, posterior interpositus, and dentate nuclei occurred through the central medial nucleus of the internal medullary lamina. These terminated within the ipsilateral ventral lateral and intralaminar nuclei. These results show that each of the cerebellar nuclei project to the thalamus and that their terminations are topographically organized in the rostral ventral tier nuclei. The clustering of autoradiographic silver grains or terminal degeneration observed in the thalamic nuclei suggests a medial-to-lateral organization of this cerebellothalamic system.},

  abstract = {The thalamic midline and intralaminar nuclei, long thought to be a non-specific arousing system in the brain, have been shown to be involved in separate and specific brain functions, such as specific cognitive, sensory and motor functions. Fundamental to the participation of the midline and intralaminar nuclei in such diverse functions seems to be a role in awareness. It is unknown whether the midline and intralaminar nuclei, together often referred to as the 'non-specific' nuclei of the thalamus, act together or whether each nucleus is involved idiosyncratically in separate circuits underlying cortical processes. Detailed knowledge of the connectivity of each of these nuclei is needed to judge the nature of their contribution to cortical functioning. The present account provides an overview of the results of neuroanatomical tracing studies on the connections of the individual intralaminar and midline thalamic nuclei in the rat, that have been performed over the past decade in our laboratory. The results are discussed together with those reported by other laboratories, and with those obtained in other species. On the basis of the patterns of the afferent and efferent projections, we conclude that the midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei can be clustered into four groups. Each of the groups can be shown to have its own set of target and input structures, both cortically and subcortically. These anatomical relationships, in combination with functional studies in animals and in humans, lead us to propose that the midline and intralaminar nuclei as a whole play a role in awareness, with each of the groups subserving a role in a different aspect of awareness. The following groups can be discerned: (1) a dorsal group, consisting of the paraventricular, parataenial and intermediodorsal nuclei, involved in viscero-limbic functions; (2) a lateral group, comprising the central lateral and paracentral nuclei and the anterior part of the central medial nucleus, involved in cognitive functions; (3) a ventral group, made up of the reuniens and rhomboid nucleus and the posterior part of the central medial nucleus, involved in multimodal sensory processing; (4) a posterior group, consisting of the centre m??dian and parafascicular nuclei, involved in limbic motor functions. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Much of the information required for complex movements is generated by the cerebellum and the basal ganglia in conjunction with the cortex. Cerebellum and basal ganglia have been thought to communicate with each other only through slow, multi-synaptic cortical loops, begging the question as to how they coordinate their outputs in real time. We found that the cerebellum rapidly modulates the activity of the striatum via a disynaptic pathway in mice. Under physiological conditions, this short latency pathway was capable of facilitating optimal motor control by allowing the basal ganglia to incorporate time-sensitive cerebellar information and by guiding the sign of cortico-striatal plasticity. Conversely, under pathological condition, this pathway relayed aberrant cerebellar activity to the basal ganglia to cause dystonia.},

Further, the anatomical pathways that provide vestibular input for cognitive processes are also distinct. This review outlines some of the current understanding of vestibular pathways contributing to the perception of self-motion in the cortex. The vestibulo-thalamic pathway is associated with self-motion cues for updating motor behaviors, spatial representations, and self versus object motion distinctions. The mammillo-tegmental pathway supplies vestibular input to create a cognitive representation of head direction. Self-motion and head direction information then converge to define self-location. By outlining the functional anatomy of the vestibular cortical pathways, a multi-sensory and multi-faceted view of vestibular related spatial awareness emerges.},

Red nucleus lesions in the rat interfere with each of these three movement elements of reaching. On the other hand, lesions to the rubrospinal tract, which originate from the magnocellular subdivision of the red nucleus, only interfere with the arpeggio movement. This latter evidence strongly suggests that impairment in aiming and supinating could be under the control of the parvocellular subdivision of the red nucleus. In order to test this hypothesis, rats were trained on the skilled reaching task and then received either complete lesions of the red nucleus or lesions restricted to its parvo- or magnocellular subdivision. In line with previous data, complete excitotoxic lesions of the red nucleus compromised limb aiming, arpeggio and supination. Lesions restricted to the parvocellular division of the red nucleus abolish supination and interfere with aiming, although the latter result did not reach significance. The results are discussed in terms of the distinct connectivity and functional significance of these two architectonic subdivisions of the red nucleus.},

Injections that filled all of VLpv labeled abundant neurons that were inhomogeneously distributed among many unlabeled cells in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCbN). Single large pressure injections made in face-, forelimb-, or hindlimb-related portions of VLpv using physiological guidance labeled numerous neurons that were broadly dispersed within a coarse somatotopographic anteroposterior (foot to face) gradient in the dentate and interposed nuclei. Small iontophoretic injections labeled fewer neurons with the same somatotopographic gradient, but strikingly, the labeled neurons in these cases were as broadly dispersed as in cases with large injections. Simultaneous injections of multiple tracers in VLpv (one tracer per somatic region with no overlap between injections) confirmed the general somatotopography but also demonstrated clearly the overlapping distributions and the close intermingling of neurons labeled with different tracers. Significantly, very few neurons ({$<$}2\%) were double-labeled. This organizational pattern contrasts with the concept of a segregated "point-to-point" somatotopy and instead resembles the complex patterns that have been observed throughout the motor pathway. These data support the idea that muscle synergies are represented anatomically in the DCbN by a general somatotopography in which intermingled neurons and dispersed but selective connections provide the basis for plastic, adaptable movement coordination of different parts of the body.

Yet, now that many other brain regions have been explored and neurophysiologists are turning to questions of how larger circuits operate, these two characteristics are starting to seem more attractive. First, the relay nature of thalamic neurons means that recording from them, like tapping into a wire, can reveal the signals carried by specific circuits. Second, the concentration of like relay neurons into nuclei means that inactivating or stimulating them can efficiently test the functions of the circuits. Recent studies implementing these principles have revealed pathways through the thalamus that contribute to generating movements and to monitoring one's own actions (corollary discharge).},

Thirteen P1 cells were also stained by juxta cellular application of the tracer. Relay cells of P1 nuclei have a morphology that differs radically from the classical descriptions of the bushy cells which represent the main neuronal type of the sensory thalamic relay nuclei. P1 cells have ovoid or polygonal somata of approximately 20-25 microm, from which emerge four or five thick, long and poorly branched dendrites bearing spines and filamentous appendages; their dendritic domains extend for up to 1.5 mm. Before leaving the nucleus 20\% of axons give off collaterals that ramify locally. All axons course through the thalamic reticular nucleus, where they also distribute collaterals, and arborize massively in the striatum and sparsely in the cerebral cortex. At the striatal level four or five collaterals leave the main axon and terminate in patches scattered dorsoventrally within a rostrocaudally oriented slab. As revealed by calbindin D-28k immunohistochemistry, only the matrix compartment receives terminations from P1 axons. The cortical branch form small terminal puffs centred upon layer VI of the motor cortex. Before entering the striatum some axons of the parafascicular nucleus give rise to descending collaterals that arborize in the entopeduncular nucleus, in the subthalamic nucleus and in the vicinity of the red nucleus. Other axons arising from the caudal part of the posterior group send descending branches only to the entopeduncular nucleus. These findings show that P1 cells belong to a distinct category of thalamic relay neurons which, beside their massive projection to the striatum, also distribute collaterals to other components of the basal ganglia. Moreover, these results provide the first direct evidence that virtually all P1 cells project to both striatum and cerebral cortex. Finally, it is proposed on the basis of morphological, histochemical and hodological criteria that the caudal part of the posterior thalamic group in the rat is homologous to the suprageniculate-limitans nuclei of cats and primates.},

  abstract = {The traditional animal model of instrumental behavior has focused almost exclusively on structures within the cortico-striatal network and ignored the contributions of various thalamic nuclei despite large and specific connections with each of these structures. One possible reason for this is that the thalamus has been conventionally viewed as a mediator of general processes, such as attention, arousal and movement, that are not easily separated from more cognitive aspects of instrumental behavior. Recent research has, however, begun to separate these roles. Here we review the role of three thalamic nuclei in instrumental conditioning: the anterior thalamic nuclei (ANT), the mediodorsal (MD), and parafascicular thalamic nuclei (PF). Early research suggested that ANT might regulate aspects of instrumental behavior but, on review, we suggest that the types of tasks used in these studies were more likely to recruit Pavlovian processes. Indeed lesions of ANT have been found to have no effect on performance in instrumental free-operant tasks. By contrast the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) has been found to play a specific and important role in the acquisition of goal-directed action. We propose this role is related to its connections with prelimbic cortex (PL) and present new data that directly implicates this circuit in the acquisition of goal-directed actions. Finally we review evidence suggesting the PF, although not critical for the acquisition or performance of instrumental actions, plays a specific role in regulating action flexibility.},

In labeling experiments, four macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) received injections of biotinylated dextran amine and wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase into the cerebellar nuclei or internal segment of the globus pallidus and cervical segments of the spinal cord, respectively. Each tracer was visualized in brain sections by sequentially using a different chromogen. Labeled terminals were plotted and superimposed on adjacent brain sections processed for Nissl substance, acetylcholinesterase, and the antigens for calbindin and Cat-301 to reveal thalamic nuclei. The labeled cerebellar terminals were distributed throughout the posterior VL (VLp), whereas the labeled pallidothalamic terminals were concentrated in the anterior VL and the ventral anterior nucleus. The spinothalamic input was directed mostly to the ventral posterior complex and cells just caudal to it. In addition, the patches of spinothalamic terminations intermingled and partly overlapped with the cerebellothalamic, but not with the pallidothalamic terminations within VLp. The regions of overlap of somatosensory and cerebellar inputs within the VLp of the present study appear to correspond to the reported locations of the tremor-related cells in parkinsonian patients. Thus, the overlapping spinothalamic and cerebellar inputs may provide a substrate for the altered activity of motor thalamic neurons in such patients.},

One class of spinal interneurons implicated in the control of mammalian forelimb movement, cervical propriospinal neurons (PNs), has the potential to convey an internal copy of premotor signals through dual innervation of forelimb-innervating motor neurons and precerebellar neurons of the lateral reticular nucleus. Here we examine whether the PN internal copy pathway functions in the control of goal-directed reaching. In mice, PNs include a genetically accessible subpopulation of cervical V2a interneurons, and their targeted ablation perturbs reaching while leaving intact other elements of forelimb movement. Moreover, optogenetic activation of the PN internal copy branch recruits a rapid cerebellar feedback loop that modulates forelimb motor neuron activity and severely disrupts reaching kinematics. Our findings implicate V2a PNs as the focus of an internal copy pathway assigned to the rapid updating of motor output during reaching behaviour.},

The effects of bilateral pyramidal tract interruption were reported in the preceding paper (Lawrence and Kuypers, 1968). It was shown that in the absence of the pyramidal tracts, the descending subcorticospinal pathways are capable of directing a wide range of activity of body and limbs. In the monkey the subcorticospinal pathways (Figure 1) which descend through- out the spinal cord have been grouped into a ventromedial and a lateral system on the basis of their terminal distribution pattern in the spinal grey matter (Kuypers et ah, 1962). The fibres of the ventromedial system occupy a ventral and medial position in the lower brain-stem and descend in the spinal cord in the ventral, the ventrolateral and the medial parts of the lateral funiculi. These fibres are derived primarily from the vestibular nuclei, the interstitial nucleus of Cajal and the medial pontine and medul- lary reticular formation and terminate preferentially in the ventral and medial parts of the interauncial zone. The fibres of the lateral system occupy a lateral position in the lower brain-stem, and descend into the lateral funiculus of the spinal cord.

Based on these projections, it has been proposed that these classes are structurally homologous to the primate external (GPe) and internal (GPi) pallidal segments. To test the hypothesis that the two area X pallidal types are functionally homologous to GPe and GPi neurons, we recorded from neurons in area X of singing juvenile male zebra finches, and directly compared their firing patterns to neurons recorded in the primate pallidus. In area X, we found two cell classes that exhibited high firing (HF) rates ({$>$}60 Hz) characteristic of pallidal neurons. HF-1 neurons, like most GPe neurons we examined, exhibited large firing rate modulations, including bursts and long pauses. In contrast, HF-2 neurons, like GPi neurons, discharged continuously without bursts or long pauses. To test whether HF-2 neurons were the output neurons that project to the thalamus, we next recorded directly from pallidal axon terminals in thalamic nucleus DLM, and found that all terminals exhibited singing-related firing patterns indistinguishable from HF-2 neurons. Our data show that singing-related neural activity distinguishes two putative pallidal cell types in area X: thalamus-projecting neurons that exhibit activity similar to the primate GPi, and non-thalamus-projecting neurons that exhibit activity similar to the primate GPe. These results suggest that song learning in birds and motor learning in mammals use conserved basal ganglia signaling strategies.},

A total of 29 axons connected to their parent cell body were entirely reconstructed from serial sections with a camera lucida. Our investigation shows that the CM and Pf nuclei in primates comprise three types of projection neurons: (1) neurons that innervate densely and focally the striatum; (2) neurons that arborize diffusely in the cerebral cortex; and (3) neurons that innervate both striatum and cerebral cortex. Striatal innervation of CM origin consists of dense clusters of axon terminals exhibiting pedunculated varicosities and forming oblique bands in the dorsolateral sector of putamen (sensorimotor striatal territory). The same type of striatal innervation occurs in the head of caudate nucleus (associative striatal territory) in cases of Pf-labeled neurons. The CM neurons that target cerebral cortex arborize principally in motor and premotor areas, whereas Pf neurons innervate chiefly prefrontal areas. Cortical innervation from both nuclei is much more profuse in layers V and VI than in layer I. Our three-dimensional reconstruction studies show that dendritic and axonal arborizations of CM neurons extend essentially along the sagittal plane. These results revealed that, in contrast to rodents where virtually all Pf neurons project to both striatum and cortex, the primate CM/Pf complex harbors several types of highly patterned projection neurons. As such, this complex might be considered as an integral part of the widely distributed basal ganglia neuronal system.},

  abstract = {From an evolutionary perspective, it is clear that basic motor functions such as locomotion and posture are largely controlled by neural circuitries residing in the spinal cord and brain-stem. The control of voluntary movements such as skillful reaching and grasping is generally considered to be governed by neural circuitries in the motor cortex that connect directly to motoneurons via the corticomotoneuronal (CM) pathway. The CM pathway may act together with several brain-stem systems that also act directly with motoneurons. This simple view was challenged by work in the cat, which lacks the direct CM system, showing that the motor commands for reaching and grasping could be mediated via spinal interneurons with input from the motor-cortex and brain-stem systems. It was further demonstrated that the spinal interneurons mediating the descending commands for reaching and grasping constitute separate and distinct populations from those involved in locomotion and posture. The aim of this review is to describe populations of spinal interneurons that are involved in the control of skilled reaching and grasping in the cat, monkey, and human.},

  abstract = {In adult songbirds, neural progenitors proliferate along the lateral ventricles. After migration, many of the subsequently formed neuroblasts integrate into the song nuclei HVC and Area X that participate in auditory-guided vocal motor learning and singing. Recruitment of postembryonically generated neurons into HVC, rodent hippocampus, and olfactory bulb has been linked to learning and memory. The cellular identity and the role of postembryonically generated neurons in Area X are unknown. Here we describe that the majority of new neurons in postembryonic Area X of male zebra finches expressed DARPP32 but not choline acetyltransferase or parvalbumin. This suggests that they are spiny neurons. Retrogradely labeled neurons projecting to thalamic nucleus DLM were not renewed. The spiny neurons in Area X were recently shown to express FoxP2, a transcription factor critical for normal speech and language development in humans. Since increased FoxP2 mRNA expression was previously observed during periods of vocal plasticity we investigated whether this increase might be associated with neuronal recruitment. Consistent with their spiny phenotype, new neurons in Area X did express FoxP2 and recruitment increased transiently during the juvenile song learning period. Moreover we found that FoxP2 was expressed in the ventricular zone of adult songbirds but was absent from the germinal zones in adult mouse brains, the hippocampus, and the subventricular zone. Together these results raise the possibility that neuronal recruitment and FoxP2 expression in Area X are associated with vocal learning.},

  abstract = {A sexually dimorphic network of brain regions controls learning and production of song in zebra finches. How this specialized song system evolved is unknown. To start addressing this question, we focused on developmental differences between the sexes, using the expression of the calcium-binding protein calbindin (CB) during embryonic to adult stages to map out the early development of Area X, a male-specific striatal structure. We related this pattern to the expression of three transcription factors, Pax6 and Islet1 to delineate the striatal radial domains, and Nkx2.1 as a marker for cells of pallidal origin. An incipient Area X-CB+ domain became discernable at embryonic day 13 in the Islet1-ventral striatal field. This region contained many Nkx2.1-expressing cells with a morphology characteristic of migrating cells. Eight days after hatching (PHD) CB staining clearly delineated Area X. Another CB+ structure formed around PHD5 at the subpallial/pallial boundary. We call it the CB+striatal capsule (CB-StC) and discuss its relation with the previously described striatal capsule in vertebrates. The CB cell population in both Area X and CB-StC, but not in the surrounding striatum, colocalized with the striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) marker, D1-receptor associated signaling protein dopamine-and-cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kDa, DARPP32. In females, CB-positive cells were also present in the rostral striatum but did not coalesce into an Area X-like structure. We discuss possible reasons for CB expression in MSNs in songbirds and mammals, but not described in chicken striatum.},

One well established determinant of movement time is the speed\textendash{}accuracy trade-off: movement time increases with the accuracy requirement. A second possible determinant is the energetic cost of making a movement. Parkinson's disease (PD), a condition characterized by generalized movement slowing (bradykinesia), provides the opportunity to directly explore this second possibility. We compared reaching movements of patients with PD with those of control subjects in a speed\textendash{}accuracy trade-off task comprising conditions of increasing difficulty. Subjects completed as many trials as necessary to make 20 movements within a required speed range (trials to criterion, Nc). Difficulty was reflected in endpoint accuracy and Nc. Patients were as accurate as control subjects in all conditions (i.e., PD did not affect the speed\textendash{}accuracy trade-off). However, Nc was consistently higher in patients, indicating reluctance to move fast although accuracy was not compromised. Specifically, the dependence of Nc on movement energy cost (slope SN) was steeper in patients than in control subjects. This difference in SN suggests that bradykinesia represents an implicit decision not to move fast because of a shift in the cost/benefit ratio of the energy expenditure needed to move at normal speed. SN was less steep, but statistically significant, in control subjects, which demonstrates a role for energetic cost in the normal control of movement speed. We propose that, analogous to the established role of dopamine in explicit reward-seeking behavior, the dopaminergic projection to the striatum provides a signal for implicit ``motor motivation.''},

Two to 6 months after implantation of striatal primordia into adult neostriata, PHA-L was injected into two different portions of the intralaminar nuclear complex of the thalamus. In the host neostriatum, labeled fibers from the parafascicular nucleus (PF) arborized in a large region in the neostriatum, but avoided small patchlike areas. Most of the fibers from PF had irregular curved trajectories with short side branches that formed boutons. Labeled fibers from the centromedial and paracentral nuclei (CeM-PC) projected to a similarly large area within the neostriatum but did not show any nonuniformity. CeM-PC axons had relatively straight trajectories and formed boutons en passant. Both sets of thalamostriatal projection fibers were found in the grafts. Some of the labeled fibers in the grafts formed dense, focal arborizations. Compared to the host neostriatum, the distribution of postsynaptic elements in the grafts was altered dramatically. In the host neostriatum, 89\% of the terminals from PF terminated onto dendritic shafts; 93\% of the CeM-PC terminals contacted dendritic spines. However, only 47\% of the PF terminals in the grafts contacted dendritic shafts; 53\% of them terminated on dendritic spines. In grafts, 81\% of the terminals from CeM-PC region contacted dendritic spines; 19\% of them made synapses on dendritic shafts. The shift of postsynaptic elements in the grafts suggests a loss of pathway specificity in the induction of dendritic spines on neostriatal neurons in grafts.},

It is not known which song-related brain areas process this auditory information, in part because previous functional studies in adult birds have not been of sufficient duration to detect behavioral changes that might result from interference with auditory feedback mechanisms. In the present study, adult males were subjected to bilateral lesions of a nucleus known to be necessary for auditory-based song learning, the lateral portion of the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum (1MAN). Songs were then recorded over a period of time during which deficits due to removal of auditory feedback become apparent. Our data suggest that the 1MAN does not mediate the stabilizing influence of auditory feedback on adult song production. That is, while deafening produces alterations in song structure within 16 weeks, bilateral destruction of the 1MAN did not produce any substantial changes in song over this same period. These results extend a previous report by Bottjer, Miesner, and Arnold,Science, 224, 901-903 (1985) and suggest that the pathways through which auditory feedback affects adult song behavior do not involve the 1MAN. ?? 1978 Academic Press, Inc.},

  abstract = {Birdsong is a learned, sequenced motor skill. For the zebra finch, learned song normally remains unchanging beyond early adulthood. However, stable adult song will gradually deteriorate after deafening (Nordeen and Nordeen, 1992), indicating an ongoing influence of auditory feedback on learned song. This plasticity of adult song in response to deafening gradually declines with age (Lombardino and Nottebohm, 2000), suggesting that, after song learning, there continue to be changes in the brain that progressively stabilize the song motor program. A qualitatively similar stabilization of learned song can be precipitated artificially by lesions of a basal ganglia circuit in the songbird anterior forebrain (Brainard and Doupe, 2000), raising the question of whether and how these two forms of song stabilization are related. We investigated this issue by characterizing the deterioration of song that occurs after deafening in young adult birds and the degree to which that deterioration is reduced by age or by lesions of the anterior forebrain that were directed at the lateral portion of the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum (LMAN). In most respects, LMAN lesions stabilized song to a significantly greater extent than did aging; whereas old-deafened birds eventually exhibited significant deterioration of song, lesioned-deafened birds generally did not differ from controls. The one exception was for song tempo, which was significantly stabilized by age, but not by LMAN lesions. The results indicate that LMAN lesions do not simply mimic a normal aging process, and likewise suggest that the anterior forebrain pathway continues to play a role even in the residual song plasticity that is observed after the age-dependent stabilization of song.},

  abstract = {Sequential behavior has been intensively investigated in humans using so-called serial reaction time tasks(SRTT), in which visual stimuli are either presented in a random or sequential order. Typically, when the stimulus presentation follows a previously learned sequential order,reaction times are decreased compared to random stimulus presentation and become partly automated. A vast amount of SRTT findings indicates that sequential learning and performance seem to be mediated amongst others by the basal ganglia-especially the striatum-and the neurotransmitter dopamine therein. In this study we used an operant rat version of the human four choice SRTT to investigate the effect of bilateral neostriatal dopamine lesions induced by 6-hydroxydopamine on sequential learning. The rats' task was to respond rapidly to illuminated holes by nose-poking into them. During extensive training, the position of the illuminated hole followed a 12-item sequence. The outcome of this sequential training was also investigated in two tests, namely an interference test, where stimulus presentation switched between this sequential and a pseudo random order every five minutes, and a violation test, in which only one sequence item was eventually skipped. The neurotoxic lesions, which was placed before the start of training, led to the expected sub-total dopamine depletions (i.e. residual levels around 34-56\% of controls), especially in the medial neostriatum. These lesions did not lead to general motor deficits in a catalepsy task, but moderate deficits in locomotion in an activity box, which largely recovered with time after lesion. In the SRTT, rats with lesions showed impaired learning, that is, less response accuracy and slower reaction times than the control group.During a subsequent test with alternating phases of sequential and random stimulus presentations, reaction times and accuracy of the control group were superior during sequential as compared to random stimulus phases. In the lesion group, only a moderate advantage in accuracy was observed. In the violation test, another outcome measure, the control group showed an expected increase in reaction times on the violated positions. By contrast, the lesion group showed no such increase, which indicates less automation of sequential behavior in these animals. For one, these findings support previous evidence in showing that neostriatal dopamine plays an important role for instrumental behavior, in general. Furthermore,and most importantly, they suggest that dopaminergic-striatal networks also play an important role in sequential behavior, especially its acquisition.},

  abstract = {Motor thalamus (Mthal) is implicated in the control of movement because it is strategically located between motor areas of the cerebral cortex and motor-related subcortical structures, such as the cerebellum and basal ganglia (BG). The role of BG and cerebellum in motor control has been extensively studied but how Mthal processes inputs from these two networks is unclear. Specifically, there is considerable debate about the role of BG inputs on Mthal activity. This review summarizes anatomical and physiological knowledge of the Mthal and its afferents and reviews current theories of Mthal function by discussing the impact of cortical, BG and cerebellar inputs on Mthal activity. One view is that Mthal activity in BG and cerebellar-receiving territories is primarily "driven" by glutamatergic inputs from the cortex or cerebellum, respectively, whereas BG inputs are modulatory and do not strongly determine Mthal activity. This theory is steeped in the assumption that the Mthal processes information in the same way as sensory thalamus, through interactions of modulatory inputs with a single driver input. Another view, from BG models, is that BG exert primary control on the BG-receiving Mthal so it effectively relays information from BG to cortex. We propose a new "super-integrator" theory where each Mthal territory processes multiple driver or driver-like inputs (cortex and BG, cortex and cerebellum), which are the result of considerable integrative processing. Thus, BG and cerebellar Mthal territories assimilate motivational and proprioceptive motor information previously integrated in cortico-BG and cortico-cerebellar networks, respectively, to develop sophisticated motor signals that are transmitted in parallel pathways to cortical areas for optimal generation of motor programmes. Finally, we briefly review the pathophysiological changes that occur in the BG in parkinsonism and generate testable hypotheses about how these may affect processing of inputs in the Mthal.},

They are differentially involved in motor control, a process that results from operations involving the entire motor network rather than from the brain commanding the spinal cord. A given pathway can have many functional roles. This review explores to what extent descending pathways are highly conserved across species and concludes that there are actually rather widespread species differences, for example, in the transmission of information from the corticospinal tract to upper limb motoneurons. The significance of direct, cortico-motoneuronal (CM) connections, which were discovered a little more than 50 years ago, is reassessed. I conclude that although these connections operate in parallel with other less direct linkages to motoneurons, CM influence is significant and may subserve some special functions including adaptive motor behaviors involving the distal extremities.},

In particular, we show how supervised learning algorithms can be utilized in cases in which an unknown dynamical system intervenes between actions and desired outcomes. Our approach applies to any supervised learning algorithm that is capable of learning in multilayer networks. \textcopyright{} 1992.},

  abstract = {In songbirds song production requires the intricate coordination of vocal and respiratory muscles under the executive influence of the telencephalon, as for speech in humans. In songbirds the site of this coordination is suspected to be the nucleus retroambigualis (RAm), because it contains premotor neurons projecting upon both vocal motoneurons and spinal motoneurons innervating expiratory muscles, and because it receives descending inputs from the telencephalic vocal control nucleus robustus archopallialis (RA). Here we used tract-tracing techniques to provide a more comprehensive account of the projections of RAm and to identify the different populations of RAm neurons. We found that RAm comprises diverse projection neuron types, including: 1) bulbospinal neurons that project, primarily contralaterally, upon expiratory motoneurons; 2) a separate group of neurons that project, primarily ipsilaterally, upon vocal motoneurons in the tracheosyringeal part of the hypoglossal nucleus (XIIts); 3) neurons that project throughout the ipsilateral and contralateral RAm; 4) another group that sends reciprocal, ascending projections to all the brainstem sources of afferents to RAm, namely, nucleus parambigualis, the ventrolateral nucleus of the rostral medulla, nucleus infra-olivarus superior, ventrolateral parabrachial nucleus, and dorsomedial nucleus of the intercollicular complex; and 5) a group of relatively large neurons that project their axons into the vagus nerve. Three morphological classes of RAm cells were identified by intracellular labeling, the dendritic arbors of which were confined to RAm, as defined by the terminal field of RA axons. Together the ascending and descending projections of RAm confirm its pivotal role in the mediation of respiratory-vocal control.},

  doi = {10.1002/cne.22752},
  abstract = {During singing in songbirds, the extent of beak opening, like the extent of mouth opening in human singers, is partially correlated with the fundamental frequency of the sounds emitted. Since song in songbirds is under the control of "the song system" (a collection of interconnected forebrain nuclei dedicated to the learning and production of song), it might be expected that beak movements during singing would also be controlled by this system. However, direct neural connections between the telencephalic output of the song system and beak muscle motor neurons in the brainstem are conspicuous by their absence, leaving unresolved the question of how beak movements are affected during singing. By using standard tract tracing methods, we sought to answer this question by defining beak premotor neurons and examining their afferent projections. In the caudal medulla, jaw premotor cell bodies were located adjacent to the terminal field of the output of the song system, into which many premotor neurons extended their dendrites. The premotor neurons also received a novel input from the trigeminal ganglion and an overlapping input from a lateral arcopallial component of a trigeminal sensorimotor circuit that traverses the forebrain. The ganglionic input in songbirds, which is not present in doves and pigeons that vocalize with a closed beak, may modulate the activity of beak premotor neurons in concert with the output of the song system. These inputs to jaw premotor neurons could, together, affect beak movements as a means of modulating filter properties of the upper vocal tract during singing.},

Despite the fact that pigeons are nonsongbirds and zebra finches are songbirds, the projections were very similar in both species. Most descended throughout the brainstem, taking ventral and dorsal trajectories, which merged in the medulla. Those descending ventrally terminated upon the ventrolateral parabrachial nucleus (PBvl), the nucleus infraolivaris superior, a nucleus of the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVL), and the nucleus retroambigualis (RAm). Those taking a dorsal trajectory via the occipitomesencephalic tract terminated in the tracheosyringeal part of the hypoglossal nucleus (XIIts), the suprahypoglossal region, and nucleus retroambigualis. There were also substantial projections throughout an arc extending between XIIts and RVL rostrally, and XIIts and RAm caudally. Neurons throughout this arc, which include inspiratory premotor neurons at levels straddling the obex and expiratory premotor neurons more caudally (in RAm), were retrogradely labeled from spinal injections. The DM projections were predominantly ipsilateral, but there were distinct contralateral projections to all the homologous nuclei in both species. All but the projections to PBvl and XIIts were reciprocal. In summary, the projections of DM suggest that it is able to influence all the key motor and premotor nuclei involved in patterned respiratory-vocal activity.},

This distribution was found to correspond to that of a subset of cells retrogradely labeled from injections of neuronal tracers into the upper thoracic spinal cord, where motoneurons innervating the M. scalenus were located by retrograde transport. Injections of biotinylated dextran amine at the recording sites resulted in projections to the spinal cord and brainstem. Bulbospinal axons traveled in the lateral funiculus, predominantly contralaterally, and terminated in relation to the dendrites and cell bodies of motoneurons innervating the M. scalenus. Brainstem nuclei receiving projections from injections at IR loci included the retroambigualis, tracheosyringeal motor nucleus, ventrolateral nucleus of the rostral medulla, infraolivaris superior, ventrolateral parabrachial nucleus, and the dorsomedial nucleus of the intercollicular complex. In the finches, there were also bilateral projections to nucleus uvaeformis of the posterior thalamus. The spinal and brainstem projections are similar to those found in pigeon (Reinke and Wild, [1997] J. Comp.

  abstract = {The morphology of the telencephalon displays great diversity among different vertebrate lineages. Particularly, the everted telencephalon of ray-finned fishes shows a noticeably different morphology to the evaginated telencephalon of non-ray-finned fishes and other vertebrates. This makes the comparison between the different parts of the telencephalon of ray-finned fishes and other vertebrates difficult. Based on neuroanatomical, neurochemical and connectional data no consensus on the subdivisions of the adult telencephalon of ray-finned fishes and their relation to nuclei in the telencephalon of other vertebrates has been reached yet. For tetrapods, comparative expression pattern analysis of homologous developmental genes has been a successful approach to clarify homologies between different parts of the telencephalon. In the larval zebrafish, subdivisions of the subpallium have been proposed using conserved developmental genes expression. In this study, we investigate the subdivisions of the adult zebrafish telencephalon by analyzing the expression pattern of conserved molecular marker genes. We identify the boundary between the pallium and subpallium based on the complementary expression of dlx2a, dlx5a in the subpallium and tbr1, neurod in the pallium. Furthermore, combinatorial expression of Isl, nkx2.1b, lhx1b, tbr1, eomesa, emx1, emx2 and emx3 identifies striatal-like, pallidal-like and septal-like subdivisions within the subpallium. In contrast to previous models, we propose that the striatum and pallidum are stretched along the rostro-caudal axis of the telencephalon. Further, the septal nuclei derive from both the pallium and subpallium. On this basis, we present a new model for the subdivisions of the subpallium in teleost fish.},

Bulbospinal neurons were distributed throughout the dorsomedial and ventrolateral medulla, from the spinomedullary junction through about 0.8 mm rostral to the obex. Almost all of the 104 IR units recorded were located in corresponding parts of the ventrolateral medulla, rostral to nucleus retroambigualis, where expiratory related units are found. Injections of biotinylated dextran amine at the recording sites labeled projections both to the spinal cord and to the brainstem. In the lower brachial and upper thoracic spinal cord, bulbospinal axons traveled predominantly in the contralateral dorsolateral funiculus and terminated in close relation to the dendrites of inspiratory motoneurons retrogradely labeled with cholera toxin B-chain.

In all these nuclei, except XIIts, retrogradely labeled neurons were also found, indicating reciprocity of the connections. These results suggest the possibility of monosynaptic connections between inspiratory premotor neurons and inspiratory motoneurons, which, together with connections of IR neurons with other brainstem respiratory-vocal nuclei, seem likely to mediate the close coordination that exists in birds between the vocal and respiratory systems.

LM provides mossy fiber inputs to folia VI\textendash{}VIII of the posterior cerebellum and IXcd of the vestibulocerebellum. Previous research has shown that the vestibulocerebellum is involved in visual-vestibular integration supporting gaze stabiliza- tion. The function of folia VI\textendash{}VIII in pigeons is not well understood; however, these folia receive input from a tectopontine system, which is likely involved with analyzing local motion as opposed to optic flow. We sought to determine whether the mossy fiber input from LM to IXcd differs from that to VI\textendash{}VIII. Fluorescent retrograde tracers were injected into these folia, and the pattern of labeling in LM was observed. Large multipolar neurons were labeled throughout the rostrocaudal extent of LM. There was a clear mediolateral difference: 74.3\% ofLMneurons projecting to IXcd were located in the lateral subnucleus ofLM(LMl), whereas 73.8\% of LM neurons projecting to VI\textendash{}VIII were found in medial LM (LMm). This suggests that the subnuclei ofLMhave differing roles. In particular, the LMl-IXcd pathway is involved in generating the optokinetic response. We suggest that the pathway from LMm to VI\textendash{}VIII is integrating optic flow and local motion to support various oculomotor and visuomotor behaviors, including obstacle avoidance during locomotion},

  abstract = {To investigate the afferent projections to the flocculus in a nonhuman primate, we injected horseradish peroxidase into one flocculus of six rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) and processed their brains according to the tetramethylbenzidine protocol to reveal retrogradely labeled neurons. Labeled neurons were found in a large set of nuclei within the rostral medulla and the pons. The greatest numbers of labeled neurons were in the vestibular complex and the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi. There were neurons labeled bilaterally throughout all the vestibular nuclei except the lateral vestibular nucleus, but most of the labeled neurons were in the caudal parts of the medial and inferior vestibular nuclei and in the central part of the superior vestibular nucleus; the nucleus prepositus was also labeled bilaterally, primarily caudally. Modest numbers of labeled neurons were found in the y-group, most ipsilaterally, and many neurons were labeled in the interstitial nucleus of the vestibular nerve. No labeled neurons were found in the vestibular ganglion following a large injection into the flocculus. A second large source of afferents to the flocculus was the medial, paramedial, and raphe reticular formation. Dense aggregates of labeled neurons were located in several pararaphe nuclei of the rostral medulla and the rostral pons and in the nucleus reticularis paramedianus of the medulla and several component nuclei of the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis bilaterally. Several groups of cells within and abutting upon the medial and rostral aspects of the abducens nucleus were labeled bilaterally. There was a modest projection from two parts of the pontine nuclei. Both a dorsal midline nucleus ventral to the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis and a collection of nuclei in a laminar region adjacent to the contralateral middle cerebellar peduncle contained labeled neurons whose numbers, while modest, were large compared to the projections to the flocculus in other animals. This generic difference may be due to the greater development of the smooth pursuit system in monkeys and the consequent need for a more substantial input from the cerebral cortex. As in other genera, the inferior olive projected to the flocculus via the dorsal cap of Kooy and the contiguous ventrolateral outgrowth. The projection was completely crossed and large injections labeled virtually every neuron in the dorsal cap, suggesting that the dorsal cap is the principal source of climbing fiber afferents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract = {The periaqueductal gray (PAG) is known to be essential for vocalization and reproductive behavior. The PAG controls components of these behaviors by means of projections to the nucleus retroambiguus (NRA), a group of premotor neurons in the caudal medulla oblongata. In the accompanying study (VanderHorst et al., 2000 [accompanying study]), the NRA and its lumbosacral projections have been identified in the rhesus monkey. The present light and electron microscopical tracing study describes the PAG-NRA pathway in primates. To locate midbrain neurons projecting to the NRA, wheat germ agglutinin horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) was injected into the NRA in six monkeys. To determine the distribution pattern of PAG axons in the medulla oblongata, WGA-HRP was injected into the PAG and adjacent tegmentum in three additional monkeys. In one of these three monkeys, biotinylated dextran amine and cholera toxin subunit b were injected into the lumbosacral cord to retrogradely identify NRA neurons. The results show that a compact group of neurons in the medial part of the lateral PAG at the intercollicular level sends a dense projection to the NRA. The projection is bilateral with a clear ipsilateral predominance. At the ultrastructural level, there are monosynaptic contacts between PAG fibers and NRA neurons, including NRA neurons that project to the lumbosacral cord. The synaptic contacts were primarily asymmetrical and the labeled terminal profiles contained spherical and dense core vesicles. It is concluded that there exists a strong and direct PAG-NRA pathway in the rhesus monkey. Because NRA neurons projecting to the lower lumbar cord are included, the PAG-NRA projection is likely to be involved not only in vocalization but also in other behaviors, such as receptive posture.},

We studied a total of 323 units in 4 red nuclei of two monkeys. Recording sites were identified in histological sections by the locations of lesions and the reconstruction of electrode tracks. Of the units in the RNm 98.5\% discharged in high frequency bursts movement. Only 52\% showed reliable responses to somatosensory stimulation, and the responses observed were weaker than the movement-related discharge. None of the units recorded in the RNp showed strong movement-related discharge, and 51\% were completely unresponsiveness during both motor and sensory tests. A dorsolateral group of medium-sized cells that ovelaps the rostral half of the main RNm and the caudal pole of RNp appears to represent an extension of the magnocellular region. Retrograde transport ifWGA-HRP indicated that some of the cells are rubrospinal neurons. Furthermore, the discharge properties of dorsolateral neurons are like the main RNm neurons, except for lower discharge rates and smaller spike amplitudes. Mouth movements are strongly represented in the dorsolateral region. Anterograde transport of WGA-HRP from the motor cortex demonstrated dense terminal label in RNp as contrasted with light label inRNm. Retrograde transport of WGA-HRP from RNm labeled many more cells in the cerebellar interpositus nucleus than in motor cortex. We concluded that input to RNm from the cerebellum is the likely source movement-related activity recorded from cells in the RNm. The absence of appreciable movement-related activity in parvicellular red nucleus provides a clear functional distinction between this division and the magnocellular division of the red nucleus. ?? 1986.},

  abstract = {Summary: The review describes a model of vocal control, based mainly on research in the squirrel monkey, which consists of two hierarchically organized pathways. One runs from the anterior cingulate cortex via the periaqueductal gray (PAG) into the reticular formation of pons and medulla oblongata, and from there to the phonatory motoneurons. This pathway controls the readiness to vocalize. Although the anterior cingulate cortex in this pathway plays a role in voluntary initiation of vocal behavior, the PAG is involved in vocal gating at a more elementary level. The second pathway runs from the motor cortex via the reticular formation to the phonatory motoneurons and includes two feedback loops providing the motor cortex with preprocessed information needed by the latter to generate the final motor commands. One of these feedback loops involves the basal ganglia and the other the cerebellum. The motor cortex together with its feedback loops is involved in the production of learned vocal patterns. These structures seem to be dispensable, however, for the production of innate vocal patterns, such as the nonverbal emotional vocal utterances of humans and most nonhuman mammalian vocalizations. These innate vocal patterns seem to be generated in the pontine and medullary reticular formation. \textcopyright{} 2009 The Voice Foundation.},

  abstract = {Much is known about the neuronal cell types and circuitry of the mammalian respiratory brainstem and its role in normal, quiet breathing. Our understanding of the role of respiration in the context of vocal production, however, is very limited. Songbirds contain a well-defined neural circuit, known as the song system, which is necessary for song production and is strongly coupled to the respiratory system. A major target of this system is nucleus parambigualis (PAm) in the ventrolateral medulla, a structure that controls inspiration by way of its bulbospinal projections but is also an integral part of the song-pattern generation circuit by way of its "thalamocortical" projections to song-control nuclei in the telencephalon. We have mapped out PAm to characterize the cell types and its functional organization. Extracellular single units were obtained in anesthetized adult male zebra finches while measuring air sac pressure to monitor respiration. Single units were characterized by their discharge patterns and the phase of the activity in the respiratory cycle. Several classes of neurons were identified and were analogous to those reported for mammalian medullary respiratory neurons. The majority of the neurons in PAm was classified as inspiratory augmenting or preinspiratory, although other basic discharge patterns were observed as well. The well-characterized connectivity of PAm within the vocal motor circuit and the similarity of its neural firing patterns to the rostral ventral respiratory group and pre-B\"otzinger complex of mammals make it an ideal system for investigating the integration of breathing and vocalization.},

In all three species, ipsilateral projections of RA to the medulla included the tracheosyringeal part of the hypoglossal nucleus (XIIts), that innervates the syrinx, the bird's vocal organ, the suprahy- poglossal area (SH), and two respiratory-related nuclei, retroambigualis (RAm) and param- bigualis (PAm; Reinke and Wild [1998] J Comp Neurol 391:147\textendash{}163). Projections of RA to the contralateral XIIts, SH and RAm, were substantial in canaries, which use the left side of the syrinx predominantly during singing; less pronounced in catbirds, which have no lateral dominance for song control; and least pronounced in zebra finches, in which there is a right-sided dominance for song control. There were no obvious differences in the number of crossed projections in birds injected in the left or right RA. Local sources of inputs to XIIts and RAm were defined anatomically in zebra finches and canaries. RAm, including neurons in close proximity to XIIts, was found to project to XIIts and the suprahypoglossal area bilaterally but predominantly ipsilaterally. RAm also had reciprocal connections with its contralateral homologue. These results suggest a pattern of connections between premotor and motor respiratory-vocal nuclei that may be involved in bilateral control of vocal output at medullary levels, a control that involves a high degree of coordination between vocal and respiratory structures on both sides of the body.},

  abstract = {It is generally agreed that cerebellar and lemniscal pathways project to largely separate areas of the thalamus and influence different functional areas of the cerebral cortex. Cerebellar afferents arise from neurones in the deep cerebellar nuclei and terminate in the ventral lateral group of thalamic nuclei or the "motor thalamus," whereas lemniscal afferents arise from the dorsal column nuclei and terminate in the adjacent ventral posterior group of thalamic nuclei or "sensory thalamus." However, it remains unclear whether or not these pathways converge onto thalamic neurones in the border zone between motor and sensory thalamus. The aim of this study was to compare directly the locations of cerebellar interposed and dorsal column nuclei terminals in the rat thalamus by using a double anterograde labelling technique. Microinjections of dextran-tetramethylrhodamine and dextran-fluorescein were made into the interposed and dorsal column nuclei, and labelled terminals in the thalamus were examined in the same sections. The labelled cerebellar and lemniscal terminals were located in separate areas throughout most of the ventral lateral and ventral posterior lateral nuclei, and there was only a limited region around the rostral border between these nuclei where the two groups of terminals came in close proximity to each other. In this common projection zone, however, cerebellar and lemniscal terminals seldom intermingled, and they mostly occupied separate, discreet areas. The results show that cerebellar and lemniscal fibres do indeed project to the border zone between the sensory and cerebellar thalamic nuclei, but they show practically no overlap in this region and are likely to influence separate thalamic neurones.},

  abstract = {Adult neurogenesis occurs in the subgranular zone and innermost part of the dentate granule cell layer. To examine how neural precursor cells proliferate, migrate, and extend their neurites, we performed BrdU- and improved retrovirus-green fluorescence protein (GFP)-labeling analyses. Soon after labeling the majority of BrdU+ cells and GFP+ cells expressed Ki67, a cell cycle marker, and formed clusters together with PSA+ neuroblasts. Most of the Ki67+ proliferating cells expressed Hu, an immature and mature neuronal marker, and the subpopulation expressed both Hu+ and GFAP+. In the clusters, Ki67+ and PSA+ cells strongly expressed beta-catenin and N-cadherin, but PSA+ cells outside the clusters did not. Therefore, it was mainly Hu+ neuronal precursor cells that proliferated within clusters in which the cluster cells are closely associated via cell adhesion molecules, such as N-cadherin/beta-cateninIn and PSA. The newly generated cells appeared to stay in the clusters for a few days and then disperse around the clusters. The findings of this in vivo analysis and in vitro time-lapse imaging of early postnatal hippocampal slices support the notion that most postmitotic neuroblasts migrate tangentially from clusters, extending tangentially oriented processes, one of which often retains close contact with the clusters, and finally extend radial processes, or prospective apical dendrites. These results suggest that the clustering cells and tangentially migrating cells have a systematic cellular arrangement and intercellular interaction.},

  abstract = {In this paper I describe the key features of optic flow processing in pigeons. Optic flow is the visual motion that occurs across the entire retina as a result of self-motion and is processed by subcortical visual pathways that project to the cerebellum. These pathways originate in two retinal-recipient nuclei, the nucleus of the basal optic root (nBOR) and the nucleus lentiformis mesencephali, which project to the vestibulocerebellum (VbC) (folia IXcd and X), directly as mossy fibers, and indirectly as climbing fibers from the inferior olive. Optic flow information is integrated with vestibular input in the VbC. There is a clear separation of function in the VbC: Purkinje cells in the flocculus process optic flow resulting from self-rotation, whereas Purkinje cells in the uvula/nodulus process optic flow resulting from self-translation. Furthermore, Purkinje cells with particular optic flow preferences are organized topographically into parasagittal "zones." These zones are correlated with expression of the isoenzyme aldolase C, also known as zebrin II (ZII). ZII expression is heterogeneous such that there are parasagittal stripes of Purkinje cells that have high expression (ZII+) alternating with stripes of Purkinje cells with low expression (ZII-). A functional zone spans a ZII{$\pm$} stripe pair. That is, each zone that contains Purkinje cells responsive to a particular pattern of optic flow is subdivided into a strip containing ZII+ Purkinje cells and a strip containing ZII- Purkinje cells. Additionally, there is optic flow input to folia VI-VIII of the cerebellum from lentiformis mesencephali. These folia also receive visual input from the tectofugal system via pontine nuclei. As the tectofugal system is involved in the analysis of local motion, there is integration of optic flow and local motion information in VI-VIII. This part of the cerebellum may be important for moving through a cluttered environment.},

  abstract = {In birds, optic flow is analyzed by two retinal-recipient nuclei: the nucleus of the basal optic root (nBOR) of the accessory optic system (AOS), and the pretectal nucleus, lentiformis mesencephali (LM). Previous anatomical studies have shown that both of these nuclei have descending projections to structures involved in oculomotor, head movement, and postural control. In this report, using biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) and cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) for anterograde and retrograde labelling, respectively, we investigated projections from the nBOR and LM to the dorsal thalamus. After injections of BDA into the nBOR and LM, terminals were consistently found in the nucleus dorsolateralis anterior pars lateralis and pars medialis, and the nucleus dorsalis intermedius ventralis anterior of the thalamus. Some terminals were also found in the nucleus dorsolateralis anterior, nucleus dorsomedialis anterior pars magnocellularis, nucleus dorsolateralis posterior, nucleus superficialis parvocellularis, and the ventrointermediate area. Injections of CTB into the dorsal thalamus resulted in retrogradely labelled cells in the pretectal region, including LM. Numerous cells were also seen in the nBOR pars lateralis and pars dorsalis, but fewer were seen in the nBOR proper. We suggest that the AOS is providing input to a thalamotelencephalic system that may be involved in several functions including: (1) multi-sensory analysis of self-motion, (2) perception of self-motion, (3) perception of the three-dimensional layout of the environment, (4) distinguishing object-motion from self-motion, and (5) spatial cognition.

  abstract = {The striatum is divided into two compartments named the patch (or striosome) and the matrix. Although these two compartments can be differentiated by their neurochemical content or afferent and efferent projections, the synaptology of inputs to these striatal regions remains poorly characterized. By using the vesicular glutamate transporters vGluT1 and vGluT2, as markers of corticostriatal and thalamostriatal projections, respectively, we demonstrate a differential pattern of synaptic connections of these two pathways between the patch and the matrix compartments. We also demonstrate that the majority of vGluT2-immunolabeled axon terminals form axospinous synapses, suggesting that thalamic afferents, like corticostriatal inputs, terminate preferentially onto spines in the striatum. Within both compartments, more than 90\% of vGluT1-containing terminals formed axospinous synapses, whereas 87\% of vGluT2-positive terminals within the patch innervated dendritic spines, but only 55\% did so in the matrix. To characterize further the source of thalamic inputs that could account for the increase in axodendritic synapses in the matrix, we undertook an electron microscopic analysis of the synaptology of thalamostriatal afferents to the matrix compartments from specific intralaminar, midline, relay, and associative thalamic nuclei in rats. Approximately 95\% of PHA-L-labeled terminals from the central lateral, midline, mediodorsal, lateral dorsal, anteroventral, and ventral anterior/ventral lateral nuclei formed axospinous synapses, a pattern reminiscent of corticostriatal afferents but strikingly different from thalamostriatal projections arising from the parafascicular nucleus (PF), which terminated onto dendritic shafts. These findings provide the first evidence for a differential pattern of synaptic organization of thalamostriatal glutamatergic inputs to the patch and matrix compartments. Furthermore, they demonstrate that the PF is the sole source of significant axodendritic thalamic inputs to striatal projection neurons. These observations pave the way for understanding differential regulatory mechanisms of striatal outflow from the patch and matrix compartments by thalamostriatal afferents.},

  abstract = {Extracellular recordings were made from single neurones in the cerebellar thalamus (75 neurones) and the VPLc (44 neurones) of four conscious moving monkeys. The experiment was designed to establish whether the discharge of ventrolateral thalamic neurones encodes information about kinematic parameters. The animals were trained to resist unexpected perturbations of the wrist and to perform skilled, voluntary wrist movements, producing stereotyped reflex and active movements with a wide range of durations and amplitudes. Statistical analysis of the discharge pattern associated with individual trials of movement was performed. In various maintained wrist positions there was a significant correlation (P {$<$} 0.05) between frequency of tonic discharge and joint position in 40\% of the cerebellar thalamic neurones and in 54\% of VPLc neurones. The phasic neuronal discharge associated with stereotyped movement often appeared 'velocity or acceleration-like'. However, statistical analyses revealed that the phasic discharge of only a small percentage of cerebellar thalamic and VPLc neurones was correlated with duration of movement, peak velocity or acceleration. The percentage of cerebellar thalamic neurones with discharge correlated to kinematic parameters was much greater when an unexpected change in the gain between joint angle and screen display led to errors in tracking the target. It is concluded that the cerebello-thalamo-cortical (CTC) pathway carries information regarding maintained joint position but not velocity or acceleration of movement during a stereotyped task. However, the CTC pathway has a greater capacity to signal information about movement velocity and acceleration when there is a mismatch between the intended and actual movement.},

The effects of stimulation of the two cerebellar projections were essentially the same, although some regional difference of their relative strength was noted. In these cortical areas, the majority of fast and slow PTNs received convergent inputs from both DN and IN. By examining the interaction of DN- and IN-evoked EPSPs, spatial facilitation and occlusion at the level of the thalamus were demonstrated.

Experiments were conducted in chronically implanted cats with an extracellular single-neuron recording technique. VL neurons projecting to the motor cortex were identified by antidromic responses. During locomotion, the activity of 92\% of neurons was modulated in the rhythm of strides; 67\% of cells discharged one activity burst per stride, a pattern typical for the motor cortex. The characteristics of these discharges in most VL neurons appeared to be well suited to contribute to the locomotion-related activity of the motor cortex. In addition to simple locomotion, we examined VL activity during walking on a horizontal ladder, a task that requires vision for correct foot placement. Upon transition from simple to ladder locomotion, the activity of most VL neurons exhibited the same changes that have been reported for the motor cortex, i.e., an increase in the strength of stride-related modulation and shortening of the discharge duration. Five modes of integration of simple and ladder locomotion-related information were recognized in the VL. We suggest that, in addition to contributing to the locomotion-related activity in the motor cortex during simple locomotion, the VL integrates and transmits signals needed for correct foot placement on a complex terrain to the motor cortex.},

Infusions of lignocaine centered within VPLo caused hemiplegia during which movements of the contralateral arm rarely were performed in either task for a short period of time ( approximately 5-30 min). When VT responses were produced, they had prolonged reaction times and movement times and a higher incidence of trajectory abnormalities compared with responses produced during the preinfusion baseline period. In contrast, those IG responses that were produced remained relatively normal. Infusions centered within area X never caused hemiplegia. The only deficits observed were an increase in reaction time and movement amplitude variability and a higher incidence of trajectory abnormalities during VT trials. Every other aspect of both the VT and IG movements remained unchanged. Infusions centered within VLo reduced the number of movements attempted during each block of trials. This did not appear to be due to hemiplegia, however, as voluntary movements easily could be elicited outside of the trained tasks. The other main deficit resulting from inactivation of VLo was an increased reaction time in the VT task. Finally, infusions centered within VApc caused IG movements to become slower and smaller in amplitude, whereas VT movements remained unchanged. Control infusions with saline did not cause any consistent deficits. This pattern of results implies that VPLo and VLo play a role in the production of movements in general regardless of the context under which they are performed. They also suggest that VPLo contributes more specifically to the execution of movements that are visually triggered and guided, whereas area X contributes specifically to the initiation of such movements. In contrast, VApc appears to play a role in the execution of movements based on internal cues. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that specific subcircuits within the cerebello- and basal ganglio-thalamo-cortical systems preferentially contribute to movements based on external versus internal cues.},

Neuronal responses to internally and externally generated sequential movements have been studied in the motor and premotor cortex of monkeys, but the involvement of subcortical motor structures such as the thalamus have not been studied in monkeys or humans. We examined the activity of neurons during a sequential button press task in motor thalamus of parkinsonian as well as chronic pain patients undergoing implantation of deep brain stimulating electrodes. Single and dual microelectrode recordings were carried out during an internally generated task with a memorized sequence (MEM) and an externally driven task with the sequence given during task performance (follow). Average histograms of neuronal firing were constructed for each task and aligned with respect to visual cues (ready, go) or button presses (P1, P2, P3). Sequential movements were monitored with surface electromyography and hand accelerometry, and cell responses were divided into movement-defined epochs for ANOVA and post hoc means testing. Of 52 neurons tested, 31 were found to have task-related responses and 10 were task-selective with 4 responding preferentially to MEM and 7 responding preferentially to follow (1 was both). Complex responses were found including preparatory, delay period, and phase- and task-specific activity. These kinds of responses suggest a role of the thalamus in both internally and externally cued arms movement and provide some evidence for a role in sequential movements.},

In the basal ganglia, numerous medium-sized neurons throughout the striatum were labeled for GABA, while pallidal neurons, as well as a small population of large, aspiny striatal neurons, labeled for GAD and GABA. GAD+ and GABA+ fibers and terminals were abundant throughout the basal ganglia, and GABAergic fibers were found in all extratelencephalic targets of the basal ganglia. Most of these targets also contained numerous GABAergic neurons. In pallial regions, approximately 10-12\% of the neurons were GABAergic. The outer rind of the pallium was more intensely labeled for GABAergic fibers than the core. The olfactory tubercle region, the ventral pallidum, and the hypothalamus were extremely densely labeled for GABAergic fibers, while GABAergic neurons were unevenly distributed in the hypothalamus. GABAergic neurons and fibers were abundant in the dorsalmost part of thalamus and the dorsal geniculate region, while GABAergic neurons and fibers were sparse (or lightly labeled) in the thalamic nuclei rotundus, triangularis, and ovoidalis. Further, GABAergic neurons were abundant in the superficial tectal layers, the magnocellular isthmic nucleus, the inferior colliculus, the intercollicular region, the central gray, and the reticular formation. GABAergic fibers were particularly abundant in the superficial tectal layers, the parvocellular isthmic nucleus, the inferior colliculus, the intercollicular region, the central gray, and the interpeduncular nucleus. These results suggest that GABA plays a role as a neurotransmitter in nearly all fore- and midbrain regions of birds, and in many instances the observed distributions of GABAergic neurons and fibers closely resemble the patterns seen in mammals, as well as in other vertebrates.},

It has been argued that the thalamic CM-PF complex has a role in pain processing and attention. However, the functional relationship of this complex with the basal ganglia, which is considered to have a role in goal-directed movement, has not been well characterized. Here we present a hypothetical view that the thalamic CM-PF complex-basal ganglia circuit plays complementary roles in response bias. The basal ganglia are involved in creating 'reward-based pre-action bias', which facilitates the selection and execution of an action associated with a higher value. In contrast, when an action with a lower value is unexpectedly requested, the CM-PF induces an 'externally driven rebiasing' process in the striatum that aborts the pre-action bias and assists selecting and executing actions appropriate for unexpected situations. This model provides a framework for how the thalamic CM-PF complex and the basal ganglia function together in general for unexpected situations. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Single-unit recordings were made from the basal- ganglia- and cerebellar-receiving areas of the thalamus in two mon- keys trained to make arm movements that were either visually trig- gered (VT) or internally generated (IG). A total of 203 neurons displaying movement-related changes in activity were examined in detail. Most of these cells (69\%) showed an increase in firing rate in relation to the onset of movement and could be categorized according to whether they fired in the VT task exclusively, in the IG task exclusively, or in both tasks. The proportion of cells in each category was found to vary between each of the cerebellar-receiving [oral portion of the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPLo) and area X] and basal-ganglia-receiving [oral portion of the ventral lateral nucleus (VLo) and parvocellular portion of the ventral anterior nucleus (VApc)] nuclei that were examined. In particular, in area X the largest group of cells (52\%) showed an increase in activity during the VT task only, whereas in VApc the largest group of cells (53\%) fired in the IG task only. In contrast to this, relatively high degree of task specificity, in both VPLo and VLo the largest group of cells (?55\%) burst in relation to both tasks. Of the cells that were active in both tasks, a higher proportion were preferentially active in the VT task in VPLo and area X, and the IG task in VLo and VApc. In addition, cells in all four nuclei became active earlier relative to movement onset in the IG task compared with the VT task. These results demonstrate that functional distinctions do exist in the cerebellar- and basal-ganglia- receiving portions of the primate motor thalamus in relation to the types of cues used to initiate and control movement. These distinc- tions are most clear in area X and VApc, and are much less apparent in VPLo and VLo.},

  abstract = {The projection from the thalamic centre m\'edian-parafascicular (CM-Pf) complex to the caudate nucleus and putamen forms a massive striatal input system in primates. We examined the activity of 118 neurons in the CM and 62 neurons in the Pf nuclei of the thalamus and 310 tonically active neurons (TANs) in the striatum in awake behaving macaque monkeys and analyzed the effects of pharmacologic inactivation of the CM-Pf on the sensory responsiveness of the striatal TANs. A large proportion of CM and Pf neurons responded to visual (53\%) and/or auditory beep (61\%) or click (91\%) stimuli presented in behavioral tasks, and many responded to unexpected auditory, visual, or somatosensory stimuli presented outside the task context. The neurons fell into two classes: those having short-latency facilitatory responses (SLF neurons, predominantly in the Pf) and those having long-latency facilitatory responses (LLF neurons, predominantly in the CM). Responses of both types of neuron appeared regardless of whether or not the sensory stimuli were associated with reward. These response characteristics of CM-Pf neurons sharply contrasted with those of TANs in the striatum, which under the same conditions responded preferentially to stimuli associated with reward. Many CM-Pf neurons responded to alerting stimuli such as unexpected handclaps and noises only for the first few times that they occurred; after that, the identical stimuli gradually became ineffective in evoking responses. Habituation of sensory responses was particularly common for the LLF neurons. Inactivation of neuronal activity in the CM and Pf by local infusion of the GABA(A) receptor agonist, muscimol, almost completely abolished the pause and rebound facilitatory responses of TANs in the striatum. Such injections also diminished behavioral responses to stimuli associated with reward. We suggest that neurons in the CM and Pf supply striatal neurons with information about behaviorally significant sensory events that can activate conditional responses of striatal neurons in combination with dopamine-mediated nigrostriatal inputs having motivational value.},

Many influential hypotheses have grown from studies in which output signals of the BG were not blocked, but pathologically-disturbed. A weakness of that approach is that the resulting behavioral impairments reflect degraded function of the BG per se mixed together with secondary dysfunctions of BG- recipient brain areas. To overcome that limitation, several studies have focused on the main skeletomotor output region of the BG, the globus pallidus internus (GPi). Using single-cell recording and inactivation protocols these studies provide consistent support for two hypotheses: the BG modulates movement performance (``vigor'') according to motivational factors (i.e., context-specific cost/reward functions) and the BG contributes to motor learning. Results from these studies also add to the problems that confront theories positing that the BG selects movement, inhibits unwanted motor responses, corrects errors online, or stores and produces well- learned motor skills.},

These nuclei have previously been classified as part of the ascending reticulo-thalamo-cortical activating system, with studies of single neuron activity and of interruption of neuronal activity suggested that they participate in the processes of sensory event-driven attention and arousal, particularly in the context of unpredicted events or events contrary to predictions. In this article, we propose a hypothetical model that envisions that the CM-Pf complex functions in two different modes depending on the predictability of external events, i.e., one for monitoring 'top-down' biased control through the cortico-basal ganglia loop system for selecting signals for action and cognition and the other for switching from biased control to 'bottom-up' control based on the signals of salient external events. This model provides a new insight into the function of the CM-Pf complex and should lead to a better understanding of this important brain system. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and The Japan Neuroscience Society.

Injections were made in two monkeys trained to perform four out-and-back reaching movements in quick succession toward four randomly selected target locations. Following sGPi inactivations the following occurred. 1) Peak velocity and acceleration were decreased in nearly all sessions, whereas movement duration lengthened inconsistently. 2) Reaction times were unaffected on average, although minor changes were observed in several individual sessions. 3) Outward reaches showed a substantial hypometria that correlated closely with bradykinesia, but directional accuracy was unaffected. 4) Endpoint accuracy was preserved for the slow visually guided return movements. 5) No impairments were found in the rapid chaining of out-and-back movements, in the selection or initiation of four independent reaches in quick succession or in the quick on-line correction of initially misdirected reaches. 6) Inactivation-induced reductions in the magnitude of movement-related muscle activity (EMG) correlated with the severity of slowing and hypometria. There was no evidence for inactivation-induced alterations in the relative timing of EMG bursts, excessive cocontraction, or impaired suppression of antagonist EMG. Therefore disconnecting the BG motor pathway consistently produced bradykinesia and hypometria, but seldom affected movement initiation time, feedback-mediated guidance, the capacity to produce iterative reaches, or the ability to abruptly reverse movement direction. These results are discussed with reference to the idea that the BG motor loop may regulate energetic expenditures during movement (i.e., movement "vigor").},

A broad spectrum of behavioral routines and rituals can become habitual and stereotyped through learning. Others have a strong innate basis. Repetitive behaviors can also appear as cardinal symptoms in a broad range of neurological and neuropsychiatric illness and in addictive states. This review suggests that many of these behaviors could emerge as a result of experience-dependent plasticity in basal ganglia-based circuits that can influence not only overt behaviors but also cognitive activity. Culturally based rituals may reflect privileged interactions between the basal ganglia and cortically based circuits that influence social, emotional, and action functions of the brain.},

To test this hypothesis directly, we inactivated the sensorimotor territory of the globus pallidus internus (sGPi, the main BG motor output) in two monkeys trained to perform overlearned and random sequences of four out-and-back reaching movements directed to visual targets. Infusion of muscimol (a GABA(A) agonist) into sGPi caused dysmetria and slowing of individual movements, but these impairments were virtually identical for overlearned and random sequences. The fluid predictive execution of learned sequences and the animals' tendency to reproduce the sequence pattern in random trials was preserved following pallidal blockade. These results suggest that the BG motor circuit contributes to motor execution, but not to motor sequencing or the storage of overlearned serial skills.},

Statistically significant relations to the direction, amplitude, and peak velocity of the movement were found in all structures studied predominantly during the movement but also during the reaction time. For movements in a particular direction, the discharge rate was frequently a linear function of the movement amplitude and/or peak velocity. The slopes of this relation differed for different cells and comprised both positive and negative values. STN differed from both GPe and GPi in that (a) a larger proportion of neurons in STN showed significant relations to the direction of movement and (b) the onset times of changes in neural activity related to movement occurred earlier in STN than in GPe or GPi. The results of these studies suggest that cells in GPe, GPi, and STN may be involved in the control of movement parameters. Loss of the basal ganglia output related to the amplitude or velocity of movement might account for the impairments of step movements observed in Parkinsonian patients. On the other hand, deranged or excessive output related to amplitude or velocity control might result in the excesses of movement observed in other disorders, such as chorea and hemiballismus. These studies also provide direct evidence that the STN exerts a specific influence on basal ganglia output related to the control of movement parameters.},

Therefore, we studied the electrophysiological responses of neurons in the basal ganglia and cerebellar receiving-territories of the motor thalamus (BGMT and CbMT, respectively) using optogenetic activation of corticothalamic projections in awake rhesus macaques. After injections of viral vectors carrying the excitatory opsins ChR2 or C1V1 into the primary motor and premotor cortices of two monkeys, we used optrodes to light activate opsin-expressing neurons in cortex or their terminals in the thalamus while simultaneously recording the extracellular activity of neurons in the vicinity of the stimulation sites. As expected, light activation of opsins in the cerebral cortex evoked robust, short-latency increases in firing of cortical neurons. In contrast, light stimulation of corticothalamic terminals induced small-amplitude, long-latency increases and/or decreases of activity in thalamic neurons. In postmortem material, opsins were found to be expressed in cell bodies and dendrites of cortical neurons and along their corticothalamic projections. At the electron microscopic level, opsin labeling was confined to unmyelinated preterminal axons and small terminals that formed asymmetric synapses with dendrites of projection neurons or GABAergic interneurons in BGMT and CbMT and with neurons in the reticular thalamic nucleus. The morphological features of the transfected terminals, along with the long latency and complex physiological responses of thalamic neurons to their activation, suggest a modulatory role of corticothalamic afferents upon the primate ventral motor thalamus. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study provides the first analysis of the physiological effects of cortical inputs on the activity of neurons in the primate ventral motor thalamus using light activation of opsin-containing corticothalamic terminals in awake monkeys. We found that selective light activation of corticothalamic terminals in contact with distal dendrites of thalamocortical neurons and GABAergic interneurons elicits complex patterns of slowly developing excitatory and inhibitory effects in thalamic neurons of the basal ganglia- and cerebellar-receiving regions of the motor thalamus. Our observations suggest a modulatory (instead of a "driver") role of the corticothalamic system in the primate ventral motor thalamus.},

A single light pulse was sufficient to elicit movements with short latencies ({$<$}30 ms). Increasing stimulation frequency increased movement speed, with a highly linear relationship.

It is well recognized that people with degenerative diseases of the basal ganglia suffer from rigidly held abdominal body postures, slowing of movement, involuntary movements, or a combination of these abnormalities. However, it has not been agreed just what the basal ganglia contribute to normal movement. Recent advances in knowledge of the basal ganglia circuity, activity of basal ganglia neurons during movement, and the effect of basal ganglia lesions have led to a new hypothesis of basal ganglia function. The hypothesis states that the basal ganglia do not generate movements. Instead, when voluntary movement is generated by cerebral cortical and cerebellar mechanisms that would otherwise interfere with the desired movement. Simultaneously, inhibition is removed focally from the desired motor mechanisms to allow that movement to proceed. Inability to inhibit competing motor programs results in slow movements, abnormal postures and involuntary muscle activity.},

  abstract = {Little is known of the serotoninergic innervation of the thalamus in primates; therefore, we undertook a detailed study of the distribution of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-immunoreactive neuronal profiles in the thalamus of the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus) with a specific antibody directly raised against 5-HT. All thalamic nuclei in the squirrel monkey displayed 5-HT-immunoreactive fibers, but none contained immunopositive cell bodies. The 5-HT innervation of the thalamus derived from extrinsic fibers arising mostly from the midbrain raphe nuclei and forming the transtegmental system. Most of the fibers destined to the thalamus collected into a major bundle that swept dorsoventrally within the midbrain tegmentum and coursed beneath the thalamus along its entire caudorostral extent. Several fiber fascicles broke off from this main bundle at different levels and ascended dorsally to innervate the various thalamic nuclei. Overall, the 5-HT innervation of the thalamus in the squirrel monkey was more massive than would have been expected from earlier studies in nonprimate species. Marked differences in the regional density of innervation were noted both between the various nuclei and within single nuclei. The most densely innervated nuclei were those delineating the principal subdivisions of the thalamic mass, that is, the midline, rostral intralaminar, limitans, and reticular nuclei, where very dense fields of isolated axonal varicosities occurred. In contrast to the rostral intralaminar nuclei, which were rather uniformly innervated, the centre m\'edian/parafascicular complex contained immunoreactive fibers and isolated varicosities distributed according to a mediolateral gradient. The habenula and the ventral anterior nucleus were among the most weakly innervated nuclei. In the latter nucleus, as well as in more densely innervated nuclei, thin varicose fibers formed numerous pericellular contacts on cell bodies and proximal dendrites of thalamic neurons. The 5-HT innervation of the lateral nuclear group as well as that of the medial and lateral geniculate nuclei ranged from very weak to dense. The mediodorsal nucleus displayed a highly heterogeneous 5-HT innervation that varied from weak in its central portion to moderate or dense in its medial and lateral borders. A moderate 5-HT innervation was observed in the anterior nuclear group. The surprisingly dense and heterogeneous 5-HT innervation of the thalamus noted in the present study suggests that serotonin may be involved in several specific functions of the thalamus in primates.},

Movement was triggered by a visual, auditory, or somatosensory stimulus. Thalamocortical neurons were identified by a spike collision, and exhibited 2 distinct types of task-related activity: 1) a sustained change in activity during the instructed preparation period in response to the instruction cues (set-related activity); and 2) phasic changes in activity during the reaction and movement time periods (movement-related activity). A number of set- and moment-related neurons exhibited direction selectivity. Most movement-related neurons were similarly active, irrespective of the different sensory modalities of the cue for movement. These properties of neuronal activity were similar, regardless of their target cortical motor areas. There were no significant differences in the antidromic latencies of neurons that projected to the primary and nonprimary motor areas. These results suggest that the thalamocortical neurons play an important role in the preparation for, and initiation and execution of, the movements, but are less important than neurons of the nonprimary cortical motor areas in modality-selective sensorimotor transformation. It is likely that such transformations take place within the nonprimary cortical motor areas, but not through thalamocortical information channels.},

After wheat germ agglutinin horseradish peroxidase injections in the rostral pole of the reticular thalamic nucleus, the distribution and amount of retrogradely labeled brainstem neurons were similar to those found after tracer injection in thalamic relay nuclei (see preceding paper42).

The injection of either CTb or FG into the substantia nigra produces prominent retrograde cell labeling in the mesopontine tegmentum. Labeled neurons are particularly numerous at the level of the decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncle, where they abound principally in the pars dissipata of the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN). A significant proportion of retrogradely labeled neurons in the PPN display ChAT immunoreactivity. Within the entire PPN, approximately 25\% of the retrogradely labeled neurons express ChAT immunoreactivity, but proportions of doubly labeled neurons are about 35\%, 25\%, and 15\% in the rostral, middle, and caudal thirds of the PPN, respectively. These doubly labeled neurons are scattered among numerous retrogradely labeled neurons that are ChAT-negative and whose number increases along the rostrocaudal extent of the PPN. Several retrogradely labeled neurons in the PPN display glutamate immunoreactivity, but very few express calbindin. This study provides the first direct evidence for the involvement of cholinergic and glutamatergic neurons in the pedunculonigral projection in primates. Furthermore, the fact that some neurons of the PPN display both ChAT and glutamate immunoreactivity indicates that single neurons in the mesopontine tegmentum may exert a two-fold effect upon dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra.

Following unilateral injections of [3H]leucine or PHA-L in the central portion of the PPN, numerous autoradiographic linear profiles or PHA-L-labeled fibers ascend to the forebrain, both ipsilaterally and contralaterally. These fibers form a compact bundle that courses in the central portion of the mesopontine tegmentum. At rostral mesencephalic levels, this bundle splits into ventromedial and dorsolateral fascicles that arborize in basal ganglia and thalamic nuclei, respectively. The substantia nigra and the subthalamic nucleus are by far the most densely innervated structures of the basal ganglia. In these two nuclei, labeled fibers arborize profusely ipsilaterally and less abundantly contralaterally. The labeled fibers in the substantia nigra are thin and varicose and arborize almost exclusively in the pars compacta, where they closely surround the soma and proximal dendrites of dopaminergic neurons. In the subthalamic nucleus, labeled fibers are also thin and appear to contact more than one neuron along their course. Numerous labeled fibers also occur in the pallidal complex, where they arborize most profusely in the internal segment. Several thick, labeled fibers oriented dorsolaterally in the pallidal complex give rise to thinner fibers that closely surround the soma and proximal dendrites of pallidal neurons. Some labeled fibers are also scattered in the striatum. These fibers abound in the peripallidal and ventral portions of the putamen, are more sparsely distributed in the remaining portion of the putamen as well as in the caudate nucleus, and are virtually absent in the ventral striatum. These results reveal that the PPN gives rise to a massive and highly ordered innervation of the basal ganglia in the squirrel monkey.

The ChAT-positive neurons in the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) form two distinct subpopulations, one that corresponds to PPN pars compacta (PPNc) and the other to PPN pars dissipata (PPNd). The ChAT-positive neurons in PPNc are clustered along the dorsolateral border of the superior cerebellar peduncle (SP) at trochlear nucleus levels, whereas those in PPNd are scattered along the SP from midmesencephalic to midpontine levels. At levels caudal to the trochlear nucleus, ChAT-positive neurons corresponding to the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT) lie within the periaqueductal gray and extend caudally as far as locus coeruleus levels. All ChAT-positive neurons in PPN and LDT stain for NADPH-diaphorase; the majority of large neurons in PPN and LDT are cholinergic, but some large neurons devoid of NADPH-diaphorase also occur in these nuclei. Cholinergic neurons in the mesopontine tegmentum form clusters that are largely segregated from raphe serotonin-immunoreactive neurons, as well as from nigral dopaminergic and coeruleal noradrenergic neurons, as revealed by tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry. Nevertheless, dendrites of cholinergic and noradrenergic neurons are closely intermingled, suggesting the possibility of dendrodendritic contacts. In addition, numerous large and medium-sized glutamate-immunoreactive neurons are intermingled among cholinergic neurons in PPN. Furthermore, at trochlear nucleus levels, about 40\% of cholinergic neurons display glutamate immunoreactivity, whereas other neurons express glutamate or ChAT immunoreactivity only. This study demonstrates that 1) cholinergic neurons remain largely segregated from monoaminergic neurons throughout the mesopontine tegmentum and 2) PPN contains cholinergic and glutamatergic neurons as well as neurons coexpressing ChAT and glutamate in primates.},

  abstract = {In addition to the cerebral cortex, the striatum receives excitatory input from the thalamus. The centromedian (centre median, CM) and parafascicular (Pf) nuclei are an important source of thalamostriatal projections. Anterograde tract-tracing indicates the CM-Pf complex provides dense afferents to the matrix compartment of the striatum. Whereas CM projects to the entire sensorimotor territory of the striatum, the Pf provides complementary input to the entire associative sector. The Pf also provides lighter input to the nucleus accumbens. Both CM and Pf provide light to moderately dense inputs to other components of the basal ganglia in a largely complementary manner, covering motor or associative-limbic territories of the subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus and ventral midbrain. In turn, the CM and Pf receive mainly segregated input from parallel motor and associative-limbic circuits of the basal ganglia. The CM and Pf may therefore be considered important participants in parallel processing of motor and associative-limbic information in the basal ganglia. Connections of the CM and Pf with other thalamic nuclei suggest they also participate in integrative functions within the thalamus. In addition, inputs from the brainstem reticular core, reciprocal connections with the cerebral cortex and reticular thalamic nucleus suggest a role in state-dependant information processing. Consideration of the differential connections of the CM and Pf, and better understanding of their role in pathophysiology, may eventually lead to development of an important new target for relief of a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {No previous report in any species has examined comprehensively the projections of the median raphe (MR) nucleus with modern tracing techniques. The present report represents an in depth analysis of the projections of MR by use of the anterograde anatomical tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin. MR fibers descend along the midline within the brainstem and mainly ascend within the medial forebrain bundle in the forebrain. MR fibers distribute densely to the following brainstem/forebrain sites: caudal raphe nuclei, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, dorsal raphe nucleus, interpeduncular nucleus, medial mammillary body, supramammillary nucleus, posterior nucleus and perifornical region of the hypothalamus, midline and intralaminar nuclei of thalamus, dopamine-containing cell region of medial zona incerta, lateral habenula, horizontal and vertical limbs of the diagonal band nuclei, medial septum, and hippocampal formation. Virtually all of these structures lie on or close to the midline, indicating that the MR represents a midline/para-midline system of projections. Overall, MR projections to the cortex are light. MR projects moderately to the perirhinal, entorhinal and frontal cortices, but sparingly to remaining regions of cortex. A comparison of MR with dorsal raphe (DR) projections (Vertes RP. 1991. J Comp Neurol 313:643-668) shows that these two major serotonin-containing cell groups of the midbrain distribute to essentially nonoverlapping regions of the forebrain; that is, the MR and DR project to complementary sites in the forebrain. A direct role for the MR in the desynchronization of the electroencephalographic activity of the hippocampus and its possible consequences for memory-associated functions of the hippocampus is discussed.},

  abstract = {Ascending projections from the medial pontine reticular formation, the mesencephalic reticular formation, and the median raphe nucleus were examined using the autoradiographic technique. The majority of the ascending fibers labeled after injections of [3H]-leucine into the nucleus pontis caudalis (RPC) course through the brainstem within the tracts of Forel (tractus fasciculorum tegmenti of Forel) and directly ventral to them. At the caudal diencephalon, Forel's bundle divides into dorsal and ventral components bound primarily for the dorsal thalamus and the subthalamus, respectively. RPC fibers project to several regions involved in oculomotor/visual functions. These include the abducens nucleus, the intermediate gray layer of the superior colliculus (SCi), the anterior pretectal nucleus (APN), the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (LGNv), and regions of the central gray directly bordering the oculomotor nucleus, the interstitial nucleus of Cajal, and the nucleus of Darkschewitsch. Few, if any, fibers from RPC (or from nucleus pontis oralis-RPO) terminate within the oculomotor nucleus proper. Other sites receiving heavy projections from the RPC include adjacent regions of the pontomesencephalic reticular formation (RF), the parafascicular (PF) and central lateral (CL) nuclei of the thalamus and the fields of Forel/zona incerta (FF-ZI). RPO fibers also ascend predominantly in Forel's bundle. Other ascending tracts for these fibers are the medial longitudinal fasciculus and the central tegmental tract (CTT). RPO fibers distribute significantly to the same structures of the oculomotor/visual system receiving projections from RPC. The RPO projections to the SCi and the APN are particularly pronounced. RPO fibers terminate heavily in several nuclei located ventrally within the rostral midbrain/caudal diencephalon. These include major dopamine-containing cell groups (the retrorubral nucleus, the ventral tegmental area, and the substantia nigra-pars compacta) as well as the interpeduncular nucleus, the lateral mammillary nucleus, and the supramammillary nucleus. Other prominent targets for RPO fibers include the mesencephalic RF, specific regions of the central gray, the PF, the CL, the paracentral and central medial nuclei of the thalamus, and the FF/ZI. The major bundle of the ascending fibers labeled after injections of the mesencephalic reticular formation (MRF) travels within the CTT in a position just lateral to the central gray, but a significant number of labeled axons also course in Forel's bundle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Although the projections linking the caudal intralaminar nuclei with the ipsilateral striatum and STN are far more prominent, we also noticed that thalamic axons could gain access to the contralateral STN. Furthermore, a small number of STN neurons were seen to project to both the contralateral GP and PF nuclei.

  abstract = {Current models of basal ganglia circuitry primarily associate the ventral thalamic nuclei with relaying basal ganglia output to the frontal cortex. However, some studies have demonstrated projections from the ventral anterior (VA) and ventral lateral (VL) thalamic nuclei to the striatum, suggesting that these nuclei directly modulate the striatum. VA/VL nuclei have specific connections with primary, supplementary, premotor, and cingulate motor cortices indicating their involvement in motor function. These areas mediate different aspects of motor control such as movement execution, motor learning, and sensorimotor integration. Increasing evidence indicates that functionally related motor areas have convergent projections to the dorsal striatum, suggesting that integration of different aspects of motor control occur at the level of the striatum. This study examines the organization of VA/VL thalamic inputs to the dorsal "motor" striatum to determine how this afferent projection is organized with respect to corticostriatal afferents from motor, premotor, and cingulate motor areas. Motor cortical projections to specific dorsal striatal regions arose from multiple areas, including components from primary motor, premotor, supplementary, and cingulate motor areas. Diverse motor cortical projections to a given dorsal striatal region indicated convergence of functionally related corticostriatal motor pathways. Most dorsal striatal sites received dense thalamic inputs from the VL pars oralis nucleus. Additional thalamostriatal projections arose from VA, VL pars caudalis, and ventral posterior lateral pars oralis nuclei and Olszewski's Area X. Our results provide evidence for convergent striatal projections from interconnected ventral thalamic and cortical motor areas, suggesting that these afferents modulate the same striatal output circuits.},

In order to provide a complete map of the midline and intralaminar thalamostriatal projections, PHA-L injections were also made in those parts of the intralaminar nuclei that project to the dorsal striatum. The relationship of thalamic afferent fibres with the compartmental organization of the ventral striatum was assessed by combining PHA-L tracing and enkephalin immunohistochemistry. The various midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei project to longitudinally oriented striatal sectors. The paraventricular thalamic nucleus sends most of its fibres to medial parts of the nucleus accumbens and the olfactory tubercle, whereas smaller contingents of fibres terminate in the lateral part of the nucleus accumbens and the most ventral, medial, and caudal parts of the caudate-putamen complex. The projections of the parataenial nucleus are directed towards central and ventral parts of the nucleus accumbens and intermediate mediolateral parts of the olfactory tubercle. The intermediodorsal nucleus projects to lateral parts of the nucleus accumbens and the olfactory tubercle and to ventral parts of the caudate-putamen. The projection of the rhomboid nucleus is restricted to the rostrolateral extreme of the striatum. A diffuse projection to the ventral striatum arises from neurons ventral and caudal to the nucleus reuniens rather than from cells inside the nucleus. Fibres from the central medial nucleus terminate centrally and dorsolaterally in the rostral part of the nucleus accumbens and medially in the caudate-putamen. Successively more lateral positions in the caudate-putamen are occupied by fibres from the paracentral and central lateral nuclei, respectively. The lateral part of the parafascicular nucleus projects to the most lateral part of the caudate-putamen, whereas projections from the medial part of this nucleus terminate in the medial part of the caudate-putamen and in the dorsolateral part of the nucleus accumbens. Furthermore, a rostral to caudal gradient in a midline or intralaminar nucleus corresponds to a dorsal to ventral and rostral to caudal gradient in the striatum. In the ventral striatum, thalamic afferent fibres in the "shell" region of the nucleus accumbens avoid areas of high cell density and weak enkephalin immunoreactivity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Four days after rabies injections into these MI regions, neuronal labeling occurred in the striatum and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) through the cortico-basal ganglia loop circuits. In the striatum, two distinct sets of the labeling were observed: one in the dorsal putamen, and the other in the ventral striatum (ventromedial putamen and nucleus accumbens). The dorsal striatal labeling was somatotopically arranged and its distribution pattern was in good accordance with that of the corticostriatal inputs, such that the hindlimb, orofacial, or forelimb area was located in the dorsal, ventral, or intermediate zone of the putamen, respectively. The distribution pattern of the ventral striatal labeling was essentially the same in all cases. In the STN, the somatotopic arrangement of labeled neurons was in register with that of corticosubthalamic inputs. The present results suggest that the cortico-basal ganglia motor circuits involving the dorsal putamen and the STN may constitute separate closed loops based on the somatotopy, while the ventral striatum provides common multisynaptic projections to all body-part representations in the MI. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.},

  abstract = {Anatomical findings in primates and rodents have led to a description of several parallel segregated basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits leading from a distinct frontocortical area, via separate regions in the basal ganglia and the thalamus, back to the frontocortical area from which the circuit originates. One of the questions raised by the concept of parallelism is whether and how the different circuits interact. The present Commentary proposes that interaction is inherent in the neural architecture of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits. This proposal is based on the re-examination of the data on the topographical organization of the frontocortical-basal ganglia connections which indicates that each circuit-engaged striatal region sends divergent projections to parts of both substantia nigra pars reticulata and the internal segment of the globus pallidus (each ventral striatal region sends divergent projections to parts of ventral pallidum, substantia nigra pars reticulata and globus pallidus), and this segregation is maintained at subsequent thalamic and frontocortical levels. This results in an asymmetry in the frontal cortex-basal ganglia relationships, so that while each frontocortical subfield innervates one striatal region, each striatal region influences the basal ganglia output to two frontocortical subfields. Because of this asymmetry, at least one of the frontocortical targets of a given circuit-engaged striatal region is not the source of its frontocortical input. Since this organization is inconsistent with an arrangement in closed segregated circuits we introduce the concept of a "split circuit". A split circuit emanates from one frontocortical area, but terminates in two frontocortical areas. Thus, a split circuit contains at least one "open" striato-fronto-cortical pathway, that leads from a circuit-engaged striatal region to a frontocortical area which is a source of a different circuit. In this manner split circuits are interconnected via their open pathways. The second striato-fronto-cortical pathway of a split circuit can be another open pathway, or it can re-enter the frontocortical area of origin, forming a closed circuit. On the basis of the available anatomical data we tentatively identified a motor, an associative, and a limbic split circuit, each containing a closed circuit and an open pathway. The motor split circuit contains a closed motor circuit that re-enters the motor and premotor cortical areas and an open motor pathway that terminates in the associative prefrontal cortex. The associative split circuit contains a closed associative circuit that re-enters the associative prefrontal cortex and an open associative pathway that terminates in the premotor cortex. The limbic split circuit contains a closed limbic circuit that re-enters the limbic prefrontal cortex, an open limbic pathway that terminates in the associative prefrontal cortex, and possibly an additional open limbic pathway terminating in the motor/premotor cortices. Possible functional implications of this open interconnected organization of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits are discussed. ?? 1994.},

To account for the variety of clinical manifestations associated with insults to various parts of the basal ganglia we propose a model in which specific types of basal ganglia disorders are associated with changes in the function of subpopulations of striatal projection neurons. This model is based on a synthesis of experimental animal and post-mortem human anatomic and neurochemical data. Hyperkinetic disorders, which are characterized by an excess of abnormal movements, are postulated to result from the selective impairment of striatal neurons projecting to the lateral globus pallidus. Hypokinetic disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, are hypothesized to result from a complex series of changes in the activity of striatal projection neuron subpopulations resulting in an increase in basal ganglia output. This model suggests that the activity of subpopulations of striatal projection neurons is differentially regulated by striatal afferents and that different striatal projection neuron subpopulations may mediate different aspects of motor control.},

The origins of these amplification effects are to be found in specialized cortical areas of the frontal and parietal lobes that have been described as the anterior and posterior attention systems.

We focus on recent studies that have directly assessed the hippocampal role in concept learning with an innovative appraoch that combiens computational modeling and sophisticated nueorimaging measures.

  abstract = {The literature on concept formation has demonstrated that humans are capable of learning concepts incrementally, with a variety of attribute types, and in both supervised and unsupervised settings. Many models of concept formation focus on a subset of these characteristics, but none account for all of them. In this paper, we present TRESTLE, an incremental account of probabilistic concept formation in structured domains that unifies prior concept learning models. TRESTLE works by creating a hierarchical categorization tree that can be used to predict missing attribute values and cluster sets of examples into conceptually meaningful groups. It updates its knowledge by partially matching novel structures and sorting them into its categorization tree. Finally, the system supports mixed-data representations, including nominal, numeric, relational, and component attributes. We evaluate TRESTLE's performance on a supervised learning task and an unsupervised clustering task. For both tasks, we compare it to a nonincremental model and to human participants. We find that this new categorization model is competitive with the nonincremental approach and more closely approximates human behavior on both tasks. These results serve as an initial demonstration of TRESTLE's capabilities and show that, by taking key characteristics of human learning into account, it can better model behavior than approaches that ignore them. 1.},

  doi = {10.1101/264895},
  abstract = {Through selective attention, decision-makers can learn to ignore behaviorally-irrelevant stimulus dimensions. This can improve learning and can increase the perceptual discriminability of relevant stimulus information. Across cognitive models of categorization, this is typically accomplished through the inclusion of attentional parameters, which provide information about the importance of each stimulus dimension during decision-making. These parameters are often described geometrically, such that perceptual differences over relevant psychological dimensions are accentuated (or stretched), and differences over irrelevant dimensions are down-weighted (or compressed). An open question is whether these attention parameters are reflected in the brain. We examined two published fMRI datasets in which participants learned to categorize stimuli with features that differed in their relevancy. Attentional parameters were derived for each participants using formal categorization models fit to behavioral data. Using multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA), we found that when greater attentional weight was devoted to a particular visual feature (e.g., "color"), its value (e.g., "red") was more easily decoded from occipitotemporal cortex. This effect was sufficiently sensitive to reflect individual differences in conceptual knowledge, indicating that occipitotemporal stimulus representations are embedded within a space similar to that formalized by classic categorization theory.},

Often, new goals require updating conceptual knowledge to reflect relationships based on different goal-relevant features. Here, our aim is to determine how hippocampal (HPC) object representations are organized and updated to reflect changing conceptual knowledge. Participants learned two classification tasks in which successful learning required attention to different stimulus features, thus providing a means to index how representations of individual stimuli are reorganized according to changing task goals. We used a computational learning model to capture how people attended to goal-relevant features and organized object representations based on those features during learning. Using representational similarity analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging data, we demonstrate that neural representations in left anterior HPC correspond with model predictions of concept organization. Moreover, we show that during early learning, when concept updating is most consequential, HPC is functionally coupled with prefrontal regions. Based on these findings, we propose that when task goals change, object representations in HPC can be organized in new ways, resulting in updated concepts that highlight the features most critical to the new goal.},

Models that learn via changes to connections help explain this organization. These models discover the structure in ensembles of items if learning of each item is gradual and interleaved with learning about other items. This suggests that the neocortex learns slowly to discover the structure in ensembles of experiences.

Spiking neuron models capable of reproducing a wide variety of these effects remain elusive. We present a model called the Attentional Routing Circuit (ARC) that provides a mechanistic description of selective attentional processing in cortex. The model is described mathematically and implemented at the level of individual spiking neurons, with the computations for performing selective attentional processing being mapped to specific neuron types and laminar circuitry. The model is used to simulate three studies of attention in macaque, and is shown to quantitatively match several observed forms of attentional modulation. Specifically, ARC demonstrates that with shifts of spatial attention, neurons may exhibit shifting and shrinking of receptive fields; increases in responses without changes in selectivity for non-spatial features (i.e. response gain), and; that the effect on contrast-response functions is better explained as a response-gain effect than as contrast-gain. Unlike past models, ARC embodies a single mechanism that unifies the above forms of attentional modulation, is consistent with a wide array of available data, and makes several specific and quantifiable predictions.},

  abstract = {Connectionist networks in which information is stored in weights on connections among simple processing units have attracted considerable interest in cognitive science. Much of the interest centers around two characteristics of these networks. First, the weights on connections between units need not be prewired by the model builder but rather may be established through training in which items to be learned are presented repeatedly to the network and the connection weights are adjusted in small increments according to a learning algorithm. Second, the networks may represent information in a distributed fashion. This chapter discusses the catastrophic interference in connectionist networks. Distributed representations established through the application of learning algorithms have several properties that are claimed to be desirable from the standpoint of modeling human cognition. These properties include content-addressable memory and so-called automatic generalization in which a network trained on a set of items responds correctly to other untrained items within the same domain. New learning may interfere catastrophically with old learning when networks are trained sequentially. The analysis of the causes of interference implies that at least some interference will occur whenever new learning may alter weights involved in representing old learning, and the simulation results demonstrate only that interference is catastrophic in some specific networks. \textcopyright{} 1989 Academic Press Inc.},

  abstract = {Humans and animals have the ability to continually acquire and fine-tune knowledge throughout their lifespan. This ability is mediated by a rich set of neurocognitive functions that together contribute to the early development and experience-driven specialization of our sensorimotor skills. Consequently, the ability to learn from continuous streams of information is crucial for computational learning systems and autonomous agents (inter)acting in the real world. However, continual lifelong learning remains a long-standing challenge for machine learning and neural network models since the incremental acquisition of new skills from non-stationary data distributions generally leads to catastrophic forgetting or interference. This limitation represents a major drawback also for state-of-the-art deep neural network models that typically learn representations from stationary batches of training data, thus without accounting for situations in which the number of tasks is not known a priori and the information becomes incrementally available over time. In this review, we critically summarize the main challenges linked to continual lifelong learning for artificial learning systems and compare existing neural network approaches that alleviate, to different extents, catastrophic interference. Although significant advances have been made in domain-specific continual lifelong learning with neural networks, extensive research efforts are required for the development of general-purpose artificial intelligence and autonomous agents. We discuss well-established research and recent methodological trends motivated by experimentally observed lifelong learning factors in biological systems. Such factors include principles of neurosynaptic stability-plasticity, critical developmental stages, intrinsically motivated exploration, transfer learning, and crossmodal integration.},

  abstract = {Evolution and development are interdependent, particularly with regard to the construction of the nervous system and its position as the machine that produces behavior. On the one hand, the processes directing development and plasticity of the brain provide avenues through which natural selection can sculpt neural cell fate and connectivity, and on the other hand, they are themselves subject to selection pressure. For example, mutations that produce heritable perturbations in neuronal birth and death rates, transcription factor expression, or availability of axon guidance factors within sensory pathways can markedly affect the development of form and thus the function of stimulus decoding circuitry. This evolvability of flexible circuits makes them more adaptable to environmental variation. Although there is general agreement on this point, whether the sensitivity of circuits to environmental influence and the mechanisms underlying development and plasticity of sensory pathways are similar across species from different ecological niches has received almost no attention. Neural circuits are generally more sensitive to environmental influences during an early critical period, but not all niches afford the same access to stimuli in early life. Furthermore, depending on predictability of the habitat and ecological niche, sensory coding circuits might be more susceptible to sensory experience in some species than in others. Despite decades of work on understanding the mechanisms underlying critical period plasticity, the importance of ecological niche in visual pathway development has received little attention. Here I will explore the relationship between critical period plasticity and ecological niche in mammalian sensory pathways.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.cognition.2017.05.019},
  abstract = {In tests of object recognition, individual differences typically correlate modestly but nontrivially across familiar categories (e.g. cars, faces, shoes, birds, mushrooms). In theory, these correlations could reflect either global, non-specific mechanisms, such as general intelligence (IQ), or more specific mechanisms. Here, we introduce two separate methods for effectively capturing category-general performance variation, one that uses novel objects and one that uses familiar objects. In each case, we show that category-general performance variance is unrelated to IQ, thereby implicating more specific mechanisms. The first approach examines three newly developed novel object memory tests (NOMTs). We predicted that NOMTs would exhibit more shared, category-general variance than familiar object memory tests (FOMTs) because novel objects, unlike familiar objects, lack category-specific environmental influences (e.g. exposure to car magazines or botany classes). This prediction held, and remarkably, virtually none of the substantial shared variance among NOMTs was explained by IQ. Also, while NOMTs correlated nontrivially with two FOMTs (faces, cars), these correlations were smaller than among NOMTs and no larger than between the face and car tests themselves, suggesting that the category-general variance captured by NOMTs is specific not only relative to IQ, but also, to some degree, relative to both face and car recognition. The second approach averaged performance across multiple FOMTs, which we predicted would increase category-general variance by averaging out category-specific factors. This prediction held, and as with NOMTs, virtually none of the shared variance among FOMTs was explained by IQ. Overall, these results support the existence of object recognition mechanisms that, though category-general, are specific relative to IQ and substantially separable from face and car recognition. They also add sensitive, well-normed NOMTs to the tools available to study object recognition.},

  abstract = {Critical periods are phases in the early development of humans and animals during which experience can affect the structure of neuronal networks irreversibly. In this work, we study the effects of visual stimulus deficits on the training of artificial neural networks (ANNs). Introducing well-characterized visual deficits, such as cataract-like blurring, in the early training phase of a standard deep neural network causes irreversible performance loss that closely mimics that reported in humans and animal models. Deficits that do not affect low-level image statistics, such as vertical flipping of the images, have no lasting effect on the ANN's performance and can be rapidly overcome with additional training, as observed in humans. In addition, deeper networks show a more prominent critical period. To better understand this phenomenon, we use techniques from information theory to study the strength of the network connections during training. Our analysis suggests that the first few epochs are critical for the allocation of resources across different layers, determined by the initial input data distribution. Once such information organization is established, the network resources do not re-distribute through additional training. These findings suggest that the initial rapid learning phase of training of ANNs, under-scrutinized compared to its asymptotic behavior, plays a key role in defining the final performance of networks.},

  abstract = {Looking to nature as inspiration, for at least the past 25 years, researchers in the field of neuroevolution (NE) have developed evolutionary algorithms designed specifically to evolve artificial neural networks (ANNs). Yet the ANNs evolved through NE algorithms lack the distinctive characteristics of biological brains, perhaps explaining why NE is not yet a mainstream subject of neural computation. Motivated by this gap, this letter shows that when geometry is introduced to evolved ANNs through the hypercube-based neuroevolution of augmenting topologies algorithm, they begin to acquire characteristics that indeed are reminiscent of biological brains. That is, if the neurons in evolved ANNs are situated at locations in space (i.e., if they are given coordinates), then, as experiments in evolving checkers-playing ANNs in this letter show, topographic maps with symmetries and regularities can evolve spontaneously. The ability to evolve such maps is shown in this letter to provide an important advantage in generalization. In fact, the evolved maps are sufficiently informative that their analysis yields the novel insight that the geometry of the connectivity patterns of more general players is significantly smoother and more contiguous than less general ones. Thus, the results reveal a correlation between generality and smoothness in connectivity patterns. They also hint at the intriguing possibility that as NE matures as a field, its algorithms can evolve ANNs of increasing relevance to those who study neural computation in general.},

  abstract = {An important phenomenon seen in many areas of biological brains and recently in deep learning architectures is a process known as self-organization. For example, in the primary visual cortex, color and orientation maps develop based on lateral inhibitory connec- tivity patterns and Hebbian learning dynamics. These topographic maps, which are found in all sensory systems, are thought to be a key factor in enabling abstract cognitive representations. This pa- per shows for the first time that the Hypercube-based NeuroEvo- lution of Augmenting Topologies (HyperNEAT) method can be seeded to begin evolution with such lateral connectivity, enabling genuine self-organizing dynamics. The proposed approach draws on HyperNEAT's ability to generate a pattern of weights across the connectivity of an artificial neural network (ANN) based on a function of its geometry. Validating this approach, the afferent weights of anANNself-organize in this paper to forma genuine to- pographic map of the input space for a simple line orientation task. Most interestingly, this seed can then be evolved further, providing a method to guide the self-organization of weights in a specificway, much as evolution likely guided the self-organizing trajectories of biological brains.},

  abstract = {Early sensory experience instructs the maturation of neural circuitry in the cortex. This has been studied extensively in the primary visual cortex, in which loss of vision to one eye permanently degrades cortical responsiveness to that eye, a phenomenon known as ocular dominance plasticity (ODP). Cortical inhibition mediates this process, but the precise role of specific classes of inhibitory neurons in ODP is controversial. Here we report that evoked firing rates of binocular excitatory neurons in the primary visual cortex immediately drop by half when vision is restricted to one eye, but gradually return to normal over the following twenty-four hours, despite the fact that vision remains restricted to one eye. This restoration of binocular-like excitatory firing rates after monocular deprivation results from a rapid, although transient, reduction in the firing rates of fast-spiking, parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons, which in turn can be attributed to a decrease in local excitatory circuit input onto PV interneurons. This reduction in PV-cell-evoked responses after monocular lid suture is restricted to the critical period for ODP and appears to be necessary for subsequent shifts in excitatory ODP. Pharmacologically enhancing inhibition at the time of sight deprivation blocks ODP and, conversely, pharmacogenetic reduction of PV cell firing rates can extend the critical period for ODP. These findings define the microcircuit changes initiating competitive plasticity during critical periods of cortical development. Moreover, they show that the restoration of evoked firing rates of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons by PV-specific disinhibition is a key step in the progression of ODP.},

Therefore, regulation of tonic inhibition is an attractive mechanism to control the levels of cortical firing. In cortical pyramidal cells, tonic inhibition is regulated by age and several neurotransmitters and is affected by stroke and epilepsy. However, the possible role of sensory experience has not been examined. Here, we report that a brief 2-day exposure to dark reduces by 1/3 the inhibitory tonic conductance recorded in layer II/III pyramidal cells of the mouse juvenile (postnatal day 12-27) visual cortex. In these cells, tonic inhibition is carried primarily by GABARs containing the {$\delta$} subunit. Consistently, the dark exposure reduction in conductance was associated with a reduction in {$\delta$} subunit levels, which were not affected in control frontal cortex. We propose that a deprivation-induced reduction in tonic inhibition might serve a homeostatic function by increasing the firing levels of cells in deprived cortical circuits.},

Motor areas of cerebral neocortex are thought to be involved in this type of learning, possibly by functional reorganization of cortical connections. Here we show that skill learning is accompanied by changes in the strength of connections within adult rat primary motor cortex (M1). Rats were trained for three or five days in a skilled reaching task with one forelimb, after which slices of motor cortex were examined to determine the effect of training on the strength of horizontal intracortical connections in layer II/III. The amplitude of field potentials in the forelimb region contralateral to the trained limb was significantly increased relative to the opposite 'untrained' hemisphere. No differences were seen in the hindlimb region. Moreover, the amount of long-term potentiation (LTP) that could be induced in trained M1 was less than in controls, suggesting that the effect of training was at least partly due to LTP-like mechanisms. These data represent the first direct evidence that plasticity of intracortical connections is associated with learning a new motor skill.},

  abstract = {The self-organizing map (SOM) is an automatic data-analysis method. It is widely applied to clustering problems and data exploration in industry, finance, natural sciences, and linguistics. The most extensive applications, exemplified in this paper, can be found in the management of massive textual databases and in bioinformatics. The SOM is related to the classical vector quantization (VQ), which is used extensively in digital signal processing and transmission. Like in VQ, the SOM represents a distribution of input data items using a finite set of models. In the SOM, however, these models are automatically associated with the nodes of a regular (usually two-dimensional) grid in an orderly fashion such that more similar models become automatically associated with nodes that are adjacent in the grid, whereas less similar models are situated farther away from each other in the grid. This organization, a kind of similarity diagram of the models, makes it possible to obtain an insight into the topographic relationships of data, especially of high-dimensional data items. If the data items belong to certain predetermined classes, the models (and the nodes) can be calibrated according to these classes. An unknown input item is then classified according to that node, the model of which is most similar with it in some metric used in the construction of the SOM. A new finding introduced in this paper is that an input item can even more accurately be represented by a linear mixture of a few best-matching models. This becomes possible by a least-squares fitting procedure where the coefficients in the linear mixture of models are constrained to nonnegative values. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {A long-standing goal in artificial intelligence is creating agents that can learn a variety of different skills for different problems. In the artificial intelligence subfield of neural networks, a barrier to that goal is that when agents learn a new skill they typically do so by losing previously acquired skills, a problem called catastrophic forgetting. That occurs because, to learn the new task, neural learning algorithms change connections that encode previously acquired skills. How networks are organized critically affects their learning dynamics. In this paper, we test whether catastrophic forgetting can be reduced by evolving modular neural networks. Modularity intuitively should reduce learning interference between tasks by separating functionality into physically distinct modules in which learning can be selectively turned on or off. Modularity can further improve learning by having a reinforcement learning module separate from sensory processing modules, allowing learning to happen only in response to a positive or negative reward. In this paper, learning takes place via neuromodulation, which allows agents to selectively change the rate of learning for each neural connection based on environmental stimuli (e.g. to alter learning in specific locations based on the task at hand). To produce modularity, we evolve neural networks with a cost for neural connections. We show that this connection cost technique causes modularity, confirming a previous result, and that such sparsely connected, modular networks have higher overall performance because they learn new skills faster while retaining old skills more and because they have a separate reinforcement learning module. Our results suggest (1) that encouraging modularity in neural networks may help us overcome the long-standing barrier of networks that cannot learn new skills without forgetting old ones, and (2) that one benefit of the modularity ubiquitous in the brains of natural animals might be to alleviate the problem of catastrophic forgetting.},

  abstract = {A long-term goal of AI is to produce agents that can learn a diversity of skills throughout their lifetimes and continuously improve those skills via experience. A longstanding obstacle towards that goal is catastrophic forgetting, which is when learning new information erases previously learned information. Catastrophic forgetting occurs in artificial neural networks (ANNs), which have fueled most recent advances in AI. A recent paper proposed that catastrophic forgetting in ANNs can be reduced by promoting modularity, which can limit forgetting by isolating task information to specific clusters of nodes and connections (functional modules). While the prior work did show that modular ANNs suffered less from catastrophic forgetting, it was not able to produce ANNs that possessed task-specific functional modules, thereby leaving the main theory regarding modularity and forgetting untested. We introduce diffusion-based neuromodulation, which simulates the release of diffusing, neuromodulatory chemicals within an ANN that can modulate (i.e. up or down regulate) learning in a spatial region. On the simple diagnostic problem from the prior work, diffusion-based neuromodulation 1) induces task-specific learning in groups of nodes and connections (task-specific localized learning), which 2) produces functional modules for each subtask, and 3) yields higher performance by eliminating catastrophic forgetting. Overall, our results suggest that diffusion-based neuromodulation promotes task-specific localized learning and functional modularity, which can help solve the challenging, but important problem of catastrophic forgetting.},

To tackle this, we utilize deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are both capable of performing visual tasks and represent images similarly to the ventral visual stream. Specifically, we test variants of the feature similarity gain (FSG) model of attention and find that the variant of FSG that best in-creases performance is also the best match to the neural data. In addition, on a task that requires attention to one feature while reading out another, FSG can enhance per-formance. However, using gradient calculations, we show that attentional modulation should in this case depend on tuning to both task-relevant features. Thus, this work val-idates, extends, and refines an existing model of biologi-cal attention by incorporating it into a deep network.},

Much less is known of its effects on cortical electrophysiology, especially in how sensory cortex encodes the altered environment, and extant studies have generally been restricted to neurons in input laminae in sensory cortex. To extend the understanding of how an enriched environment alters the way in which cortex views the world, we investigated enrichment-induced changes in neuronal encoding of sensory stimuli across all laminae of the rat barrel cortex receiving input from the face whisker tactile system. Animals were housed in Enriched (n = 13) or Isolated housing (n = 13) conditions for 8 weeks before extracellular recordings were obtained from barrel cortex in response to simple whisker deflections and whisker motions modeling movements seen in awake animals undertaking a variety of different tasks. Enrichment resulted in increases in neuronal responses to all stimuli, ranging from those modeling exploratory behavior through to discrimination behaviors. These increases were seen throughout the cortex from supragranular layers through to input Layer 4 and for some stimuli, in infragranular Layer 5. The observed enrichment-induced effect is consistent with the postulate that enrichment causes shift in cortical excitatory/inhibitory balance, and we demonstrate this is greatest in supragranular layers. However, we also report that the effects are non-selective for stimulus parameters across a range of stimuli except for one modeling the likely use of whiskers by the rats in the enriched housing.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have shown that spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) can be used in spiking neural networks (SNN) to extract visual features of low or intermediate complexity in an unsupervised manner. These studies, however, used relatively shallow architectures, and only one layer was trainable. Another line of research has demonstrated - using rate-based neural networks trained with back-propagation - that having many layers increases the recognition robustness, an approach known as deep learning. We thus designed a deep SNN, comprising several convolutional (trainable with STDP) and pooling layers. We used a temporal coding scheme where the most strongly activated neurons fire first, and less activated neurons fire later or not at all. The network was exposed to natural images. Thanks to STDP, neurons progressively learned features corresponding to prototypical patterns that were both salient and frequent. Only a few tens of examples per category were required and no label was needed. After learning, the complexity of the extracted features increased along the hierarchy, from edge detectors in the first layer to object prototypes in the last layer. Coding was very sparse, with only a few thousands spikes per image, and in some cases the object category could be reasonably well inferred from the activity of a single higher-order neuron. More generally, the activity of a few hundreds of such neurons contained robust category information, as demonstrated using a classifier on Caltech 101, ETH-80, and MNIST databases. We also demonstrate the superiority of STDP over other unsupervised techniques such as random crops (HMAX) or auto-encoders. Taken together, our results suggest that the combination of STDP with latency coding may be a key to understanding the way that the primate visual system learns, its remarkable processing speed and its low energy consumption.},

  abstract = {In performance-optimized artificial neural networks, such as convolutional networks, each neuron makes excitatory connections with some of its targets and inhibitory connections with others. In contrast, physiological neurons are typically either excitatory or inhibitory, not both. This is a puzzle, because it seems to constrain computation, and because there are several counter-examples that suggest that it may not be a physiological necessity. Parisien et al. (2008) showed that any mixture of excitatory and inhibitory functional connections could be realized by a purely excitatory projection in parallel with a two-synapse projection through an inhibitory population. They showed that this works well with ratios of excitatory and inhibitory neurons that are realistic for the neocortex, suggesting that perhaps the cortex efficiently works around this apparent computational constraint. Extending this work, we show here that mixed excitatory and inhibitory functional connections can also be realized in networks that are dominated by inhibition, such as those of the basal ganglia. Further, we show that the function-approximation capacity of such connections is comparable to that of idealized mixed-weight connections. We also study whether such connections are viable in recurrent networks, and find that such recurrent networks can flexibly exhibit a wide range of dynamics. These results offer a new perspective on computation in the basal ganglia, and also perhaps on inhibitory networks within the cortex.},

Because of the dimensionality of the motor space, as well as the infinite possible combinations of successive motor commands, agents need compact representations that capture the structure of the resulting displacements. In the case of an autonomous agent with no a priori knowledge about its sensorimotor apparatus, this compression has to be learned. We propose to use Recurrent Neural Networks to encode motor sequences into a compact representation, which is used to predict the consequence of motor sequences in term of sensory changes. We show that sensory prediction can successfully guide the compression of motor sequences into representations that are organized topologically in term of spatial displacement.},

In order to accomplish this, neuroplastic changes appear to take place. During Braille learning, the sensorimotor cortical area devoted to the representation of the reading finger enlarges. This enlargement follows a two-step process that can be demonstrated with transcranial magnetic stimulation mapping and suggests initial unmasking of existing connections and eventual establishment of more stable structural changes. In addition, Braille learning appears to be associated with the recruitment of parts of the occipital, formerly 'visual, cortex (V1 and V2) for tactile information processing. In blind, proficient Braille readers, the occipital cortex can be shown not only to be associated with tactile Braille reading but also to be critical for reading accuracy. Recent studies suggest the possibility of applying non-invasive neurophysiological techniques to guide and improve functional outcomes of these plastic changes. Such interventions might provide a means of accelerating functional adjustment to blindness.},

  doi = {10.1098/rstb.2005.1623},
  abstract = {This year, the field of neuroscience celebrates the 50th anniversary of Mountcastle's discovery of the cortical column. In this review, we summarize half a century of research and come to the disappointing realization that the column may have no function. Originally, it was described as a discrete structure, spanning the layers of the somatosensory cortex, which contains cells responsive to only a single modality, such as deep joint receptors or cutaneous receptors. Subsequently, examples of columns have been uncovered in numerous cortical areas, expanding the original concept to embrace a variety of different structures and principles. A "column" now refers to cells in any vertical cluster that share the same tuning for any given receptive field attribute. In striate cortex, for example, cells with the same eye preference are grouped into ocular dominance columns. Unaccountably, ocular dominance columns are present in some species, but not others. In principle, it should be possible to determine their function by searching for species differences in visual performance that correlate with their presence or absence. Unfortunately, this approach has been to no avail; no visual faculty has emerged that appears to require ocular dominance columns. Moreover, recent evidence has shown that the expression of ocular dominance columns can be highly variable among members of the same species, or even in different portions of the visual cortex in the same individual. These observations deal a fatal blow to the idea that ocular dominance columns serve a purpose. More broadly, the term "column" also denotes the periodic termination of anatomical projections within or between cortical areas. In many instances, periodic projections have a consistent relationship with some architectural feature, such as the cytochrome oxidase patches in V1 or the stripes in V2. These tissue compartments appear to divide cells with different receptive field properties into distinct processing streams. However, it is unclear what advantage, if any, is conveyed by this form of columnar segregation. Although the column is an attractive concept, it has failed as a unifying principle for understanding cortical function. Unravelling the organization of the cerebral cortex will require a painstaking description of the circuits, projections and response properties peculiar to cells in each of its various areas.},

  title = {Dendritic Error Backpropagation in Deep Cortical Microcircuits},
  abstract = {Animal behaviour depends on learning to associate sensory stimuli with the desired motor command. Understanding how the brain orchestrates the necessary synaptic modifications across different brain areas has remained a longstanding puzzle. Here, we introduce a multi-area neuronal network model in which synaptic plasticity continuously adapts the network towards a global desired output. In this model synaptic learning is driven by a local dendritic prediction error that arises from a failure to predict the top-down input given the bottom-up activities. Such errors occur at apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons where both long-range excitatory feedback and local inhibitory predictions are integrated. When local inhibition fails to match excitatory feedback an error occurs which triggers plasticity at bottom-up synapses at basal dendrites of the same pyramidal neurons. We demonstrate the learning capabilities of the model in a number of tasks and show that it approximates the classical error backpropagation algorithm. Finally, complementing this cortical circuit with a disinhibitory mechanism enables attention-like stimulus denoising and generation. Our framework makes several experimental predictions on the function of dendritic integration and cortical microcircuits, is consistent with recent observations of cross-area learning, and suggests a biological implementation of deep learning.},

  isbn = {1-111-11111-1},
  abstract = {Representational models specify how activity patterns in populations of neurons (or, more generally, in multivariate brain-activity measurements) relate to sensory stimuli, motor responses, or cognitive processes. In an experimental context, representational models can be defined as hypotheses about the distribution of activity profiles across experimental conditions. Currently, three different methods are being used to test such hypotheses: encoding analysis, pattern component modeling (PCM), and representational similarity analysis (RSA). Here we develop a common mathematical framework for understanding the relationship of these three methods, which share one core commonality: all three evaluate the second moment of the distribution of activity profiles, which determines the representational geometry, and thus how well any feature can be decoded from population activity. Using simulated data for three different experimental designs, we compare the power of the methods to adjudicate between competing representational models. PCM implements a likelihood-ratio test and therefore provides the most powerful test if its assumptions hold. However, the other two approaches-when conducted appropriately-can perform similarly. In encoding analysis, the linear model needs to be appropriately regularized, which effectively imposes a prior on the activity profiles. With such a prior, an encoding model specifies a well-defined distribution of activity profiles. In RSA, the unequal variances and statistical dependencies of the dissimilarity estimates need to be taken into account to reach near-optimal power in inference. The three methods render different aspects of the information explicit (e.g. single-response tuning in encoding analysis and population-response representational dissimilarity in RSA) and have specific advantages in terms of computational demands, ease of use, and extensibility. The three methods are properly construed as complementary components of a single data-analytical toolkit for understanding neural representations on the basis of multivariate brain-activity data.},

  abstract = {A FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE FOR SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE IS TO QUANTITATIVELY RELATE ITS THREE MAJOR BRANCHES OF RESEARCH: brain-activity measurement, behavioral measurement, and computational modeling. Using measured brain-activity patterns to evaluate computational network models is complicated by the need to define the correspondency between the units of the model and the channels of the brain-activity data, e.g., single-cell recordings or voxels from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Similar correspondency problems complicate relating activity patterns between different modalities of brain-activity measurement (e.g., fMRI and invasive or scalp electrophysiology), and between subjects and species. In order to bridge these divides, we suggest abstracting from the activity patterns themselves and computing representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs), which characterize the information carried by a given representation in a brain or model. Building on a rich psychological and mathematical literature on similarity analysis, we propose a new experimental and data-analytical framework called representational similarity analysis (RSA), in which multi-channel measures of neural activity are quantitatively related to each other and to computational theory and behavior by comparing RDMs. We demonstrate RSA by relating representations of visual objects as measured with fMRI in early visual cortex and the fusiform face area to computational models spanning a wide range of complexities. The RDMs are simultaneously related via second-level application of multidimensional scaling and tested using randomization and bootstrap techniques. We discuss the broad potential of RSA, including novel approaches to experimental design, and argue that these ideas, which have deep roots in psychology and neuroscience, will allow the integrated quantitative analysis of data from all three branches, thus contributing to a more unified systems neuroscience.},

In machine learning, however, artificial neural networks tend to eschew precisely designed codes, dynamics or circuits in favor of brute force optimization of a cost function, often using simple and relatively uniform initial architectures. Two recent developments have emerged within machine learning that create an opportunity to connect these seemingly divergent perspectives. First, structured architectures are used, including dedicated systems for attention, recursion and various forms of short- and long-term memory storage. Second, cost functions and training procedures have become more complex and are varied across layers and over time. Here we think about the brain in terms of these ideas. We hypothesize that (1) the brain optimizes cost functions, (2) these cost functions are diverse and differ across brain locations and over development, and (3) optimization operates within a pre-structured architecture matched to the computational problems posed by behavior. Such a heterogeneously optimized system, enabled by a series of interacting cost functions, serves to make learning data-efficient and precisely targeted to the needs of the organism. We suggest directions by which neuroscience could seek to refine and test these hypotheses.},

  abstract = {We consider scenarios in which we wish to perform joint scene understanding, object tracking, activity recognition, and other tasks in environments in which multiple people are wearing body-worn cameras while a third-person static camera also captures the scene. To do this, we need to establish person-level correspondences across first- and third-person videos, which is challenging because the camera wearer is not visible from his/her own egocentric video, preventing the use of direct feature matching. In this paper, we propose a new semi-Siamese Convolutional Neural Network architecture to address this novel challenge. We formulate the problem as learning a joint embedding space for first- and third-person videos that considers both spatial- and motion-domain cues. A new triplet loss function is designed to minimize the distance between correct first- and third-person matches while maximizing the distance between incorrect ones. This end-to-end approach performs significantly better than several baselines, in part by learning the first- and third-person features optimized for matching jointly with the distance measure itself.},

  abstract = {Abstract In brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, the non-stationarity of brain signals is known to be a challenge for training robust classifiers as other brain processes produce signals that coincide with those resulting from the desired brain activity. One source of interference is the user's cognitive response to the provided BCI feedback. In the case of motor imagery paradigms, this feedback can for instance be a cursor moving on the screen. The response to such feedback has been shown in general to be a source of noise that can add to the non-stationarity of the brain signal; however, in this work, we show that the user's brain response to this feedback can be used to improve the BCI performance. We first show in a motor imagery task that the user's brain responds to the direction of cursor movement, which is different for the cursor moving towards or away from the target (i.e. BCI feedback), and this feedback-related information is present in frequency bands similar to those used in motor imagery...},

  abstract = {1. Multiple microelectrode maps of the hand representation within and across the borders of cortical area 3b were obtained before, immediately after, or several weeks after a period of behaviorally controlled hand use. Owl monkeys were conditioned in a task that produced cutaneous stimulation of a limited sector of skin on the distal phalanges of one or more fingers. 2. Analysis of microelectrode mapping experiment data revealed that 1) stimulated skin surfaces were represented over expanded cortical areas. 2) Most of the cutaneous receptive fields recorded within these expanded cortical representational zones were unusually small. 3) The internal topography of representation of the stimulated and immediately surrounding skin surfaces differed greatly from that recorded in control experiments. Representational discontinuities emerged in this map region, and "hypercolumn" distances in this map sector were grossly abnormal. 4) Borders between the representations of individual digits and digit segments commonly shifted. 5) The functionally defined rostral border of area 3b shifted farther rostralward, manifesting either an expansion of the cutaneous area 3b fingertip representation into cortical field 3a or an emergence of a cutaneous input zone in the caudal aspect of this normally predominantly deep-receptor representational field. 6) Significant lateralward translocations of the borders between the representations of the hand and face were recorded in all cases. 7) The absolute locations--and in some cases the areas or magnifications--of representations of many skin surfaces not directly involved in the trained behavior also changed significantly. However, the most striking areal, positional, and topographic changes were related to the representations of the behaviorally stimulated skin in every studied monkey. 3. These experiments demonstrate that functional cortical remodeling of the S1 koniocortical field, area 3b, results from behavioral manipulations in normal adult owl monkeys. We hypothesize that these studies manifest operation of the basic adaptive cortical process(es) underlying cortical contributions to perception and learning.},

  abstract = {The brain has an extraordinary capacity for memory storage, but how it stores new information without disrupting previously acquired memories remains unknown. Here we show that different motor learning tasks induce dendritic Ca 21 spikes on different apical tuft branches of individual layer V pyramidal neurons in the mouse motor cortex. These task-related, branch-specific Ca 21 spikes cause long-lasting potentiation of postsynaptic dendritic spines active at the time of spike generation. When somatostatin-expressing interneurons are inactivated, different motor tasks frequently induce Ca 21 spikes on the same branches. On those branches, spines potentiated during one task are depotentiated when they are active seconds before Ca 21 spikes induced by another task. Concomitantly, increased neuronal activity and performance improvement after learning one task are disrupted when another task is learned. These findings indicate that dendritic-branch-specific generation of Ca 21 spikes is crucial for establishing long-lasting synaptic plasticity, thereby facilitating information storage associated with different learning experiences. One remarkable feature of the brain is to encode and store new infor-mation continuously without disrupting previously acquired memories. It is believed that experience-dependent changes in synaptic strength are crucial for information storage in the brain 1,2 . However, it remains unclear whether and how synaptic plasticity induced by past experi-ences are maintained in the face of new experiences 1\textendash{}3},

  abstract = {Lifelong learning is fundamental in autonomous robotics for the acquisition and fine-tuning of knowledge through experience. However, conventional deep neural models for action recognition from videos do not account for lifelong learning but rather learn a batch of training data with a predefined number of action classes and samples. Thus, there is the need to develop learning systems with the ability to incrementally process available perceptual cues and to adapt their responses over time. We propose a self-organizing neural architecture for incrementally learning to classify human actions from video sequences. The architecture comprises growing self-organizing networks equipped with recurrent neurons for processing time-varying patterns. We use a set of hierarchically arranged recurrent networks for the unsupervised learning of action representations with increasingly large spatiotemporal receptive fields. Lifelong learning is achieved in terms of prediction-driven neural dynamics in which the growth and the adaptation of the recurrent networks are driven by their capability to reconstruct temporally ordered input sequences. Experimental results on a classification task using two action benchmark datasets show that our model is competitive with state-of-the-art methods for batch learning also when a significant number of sample labels are missing or corrupted during training sessions. Additional experiments show the ability of our model to adapt to non-stationary input avoiding catastrophic interference.},

The cortex can preferentially allocate area to represent the particular peripheral input sources that are proportionally most used. Alterations in cortical representations appear to underlie learning tasks dependent on the use of the behaviorally important peripheral inputs that they represent. The rules governing this cortical representational plasticity following manipulations of inputs, including learning, are increasingly well understood. In parallel with developments in the field of cortical map plasticity, studies of synaptic plasticity have characterized specific elementary forms of plasticity, including associative long-term potentiation and long-term depression of excitatory postsynaptic potentials. Investigators have made many important strides toward understanding the molecular underpinnings of these fundamental plasticity processes and toward defining the learning rules that govern their induction. The fields of cortical synaptic plasticity and cortical map plasticity have been implicitly linked by the hypothesis that synaptic plasticity underlies cortical map reorganization. Recent experimental and theoretical work has provided increasingly stronger support for this hypothesis. The goal of the current paper is to review the fields of both synaptic and cortical map plasticity with an emphasis on the work that attempts to unite both fields. A second objective is to highlight the gaps in our understanding of synaptic and cellular mechanisms underlying cortical representational plasticity.},

However, training artificial neural networks (ANNs) on new tasks typically cause it to forget previously learned tasks. This phenomenon is the result of "catastrophic forgetting", in which training an ANN disrupts connection weights that were important for solving previous tasks, degrading task performance. Several recent studies have proposed methods to stabilize connection weights of ANNs that are deemed most important for solving a task, which helps alleviate catastrophic forgetting. Here, drawing inspiration from algorithms that are believed to be implemented in vivo, we propose a complementary method: adding a context-dependent gating signal, such that only sparse, mostly non-overlapping patterns of units are active for any one task. This method is easy to implement, requires little computational overhead, and allows ANNs to maintain high performance across large numbers of sequentially presented tasks when combined with weight stabilization. This work provides another example of how neuroscience-inspired algorithms can benefit ANN design and capability.},

  abstract = {According to spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), the timing of the Na(+) spike relative to the EPSP determines whether LTP or LTD will occur. Here, we review our reservations about STDP. Most investigations of this process have been done under conditions in which the spike is evoked by postsynaptic current injection. Under more realistic conditions, in which the spike is evoked by the EPSP, the results do not generally support STDP. For instance, low-frequency stimulation of a group of synapses can cause LTD, not the LTP predicted by the pre-before-post sequence in STDP; this is true regardless of whether or not the EPSP is large enough to produce a Na(+) spike. With stronger or more frequent stimulation, LTP can be induced by the same pre-before-post timing, but in this case block of Na(+) spikes does not necessarily prevent LTP induction. Thus, Na(+) spikes may facilitate LTP and/or LTD under some conditions, but they are not necessary, a finding consistent with their small size relative to the EPSP in many parts of pyramidal cell dendrites. The nature of the dendritic depolarizing events that control bidirectional plasticity is of central importance to understanding neural function. There are several candidates, including backpropagating action potentials, but also dendritic Ca(2+) spikes, the AMPA receptor-mediated EPSP, and NMDA receptor-mediated EPSPs or spikes. These often appear to be more important than the Na(+) spike in providing the depolarization necessary for plasticity. We thus feel that it is premature to accept STDP-like processes as the major determinant of LTP/LTD.},

From its inception as a research topic, and despite a number of promising alternative perspectives, the study of visual search has been governed by the assumption that search proceeds on the basis of individual items (whether processed in parallel or not). This has led to the additional assumptions that shallow search slopes (at most a few tens of milliseconds per item for target-present trials) are most informative about the underlying process, and that eye movements are an epiphenomenon that can be safely ignored. We argue that the evidence now overwhelmingly favours an approach which takes fixations, not individual items as its central unit. Within fixations, items are processed in parallel, and the functional field of view determines how many fixations are needed. In this type of theoretical framework, there is a direct connection between target discrimination difficulty, fixations and RT measures. It therefore promises a more fundamental understanding of visual search by offering a unified account of both eye movement and manual response behaviour across the entire range of observed search efficiency, and provides new directions for research. A high-level conceptual simulation with just one free and four fixed parameters shows the viability of this approach.},

To enable biologists to design experiments to obtain better behavioral measurements, and computer scientists to pinpoint fruitful directions for algorithm improvement, we review known effects of artificial manipulation of the animal on behavior.

  abstract = {Self-replication is a key aspect of biological life that has been largely overlooked in Artificial Intelligence systems. Here we describe how to build and train self-replicating neural networks. The network replicates itself by learning to output its own weights. The network is designed using a loss function that can be optimized with either gradient-based or non-gradient-based methods. We also describe a method we call regeneration to train the network without explicit optimization, by injecting the network with predictions of its own parameters. The best solution for a self-replicating network was found by alternating between regeneration and optimization steps. Finally, we describe a design for a self-replicating neural network that can solve an auxiliary task such as MNIST image classification. We observe that there is a trade-off between the network's ability to classify images and its ability to replicate, but training is biased towards increasing its specialization at image classification at the expense of replication. This is analogous to the trade-off between reproduction and other tasks observed in nature. We suggest that a self-replication mechanism for artificial intelligence is useful because it introduces the possibility of continual improvement through natural selection.},

Reasoning that a complete model of auditory cortex must solve ecologically relevant tasks, we optimized hierarchical neural networks for speech and music recognition. The best-performing network contained separate music and speech pathways following early shared processing, potentially replicating human cortical organization. The network performed both tasks as well as humans and exhibited human-like errors despite not being optimized to do so, suggesting common constraints on network and human performance. The network predicted fMRI voxel responses substantially better than traditional spectrotemporal filter models throughout auditory cortex. It also provided a quantitative signature of cortical representational hierarchy\textemdash{}primary and non-primary responses were best predicted by intermediate and late network layers, respectively.

  abstract = {We propose a novel attention mechanism to enhance Convolutional Neural Net-works for fine-grained recognition. The proposed mechanism reuses CNN feature activations to find the most informative parts of the image at different depths with the help of gating mechanisms and without part annotations. Thus, it can be used to augment any layer of a CNN to extract low-and high-level local information to be more discriminative. Differently, from other approaches, the mechanism we propose just needs a single pass through the input and it can be trained end-to-end through SGD. As a con-sequence, the proposed mechanism is modular, architecture-independent, easy to implement, and faster than iterative approaches. Experiments show that, when augmented with our approach, Wide Residual Net-works systematically achieve superior performance on each of five different fine-grained recognition datasets: the Adience age and gender recognition benchmark, Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, Stanford Cars, and UEC Food-100, obtaining competitive and state-of-the-art scores.},

We found that the anatomical position of a face patch was associated with a unique functional identity: Face patches differed qualitatively in how they represented identity across head orientations. Neurons in ML and MF were view-specific; neurons in AL were tuned to identity mirror-symetrically across views, thus achieving partial view invariance; and neurons in AM, the most anterior face patch, achieved almost full view invariance.},

Experiments in macaques demonstrate an extraordinarily simple transformation between faces and responses of cells in face patches. By formatting faces as points in a high-dimensional linear space, we discovered that each face cell's firing rate is proportional to the projection of an incoming face stimulus onto a single axis in this space, allowing a face cell ensemble to encode the location of any face in the space. Using this code, we could precisely decode faces from neural population responses and predict neural firing rates to faces. Furthermore, this code disavows the long-standing assumption that face cells encode specific facial identities, confirmed by engineering faces with drastically different appearance that elicited identical responses in single face cells. Our work suggests that other objects could be encoded by analogous metric coordinate systems. PaperClip},

  abstract = {Transmission of signals within the brain is essential for cognitive function, but it is not clear how neural circuits support reliable and accurate signal propagation over a sufficiently large dynamic range. Two modes of propagation have been studied: synfire chains, in which synchronous activity travels through feedforward layers of a neuronal network, and the propagation of fluctuations in firing rate across these layers. In both cases, a sufficient amount of noise, which was added to previous models from an external source, had to be included to support stable propagation. Sparse, randomly connected networks of spiking model neurons can generate chaotic patterns of activity. We investigate whether this activity, which is a more realistic noise source, is sufficient to allow for signal transmission. We find that, for rate-coded signals but not for synfire chains, such networks support robust and accurate signal reproduction through up to six layers if appropriate adjustments are made in synaptic strengths. We investigate the factors affecting transmission and show that multiple signals can propagate simultaneously along different pathways. Using this feature, we show how different types of logic gates can arise within the architecture of the random network through the strengthening of specific synapses.},

It is not well understood how these reward effects influence activity in sensory cortices that represent low-level stimulus features. Here, we investigated the effects of reward information in the primary visual cortex (area V1) of monkeys. We found that the reward value of a stimulus relative to the value of other stimuli is a good predictor of V1 activity. Relative value biases the competition between stimuli, just as has been shown for selective attention. The neuronal latency of this reward value effect in V1 was similar to the latency of attentional influences. Moreover, V1 neurons with a strong value effect also exhibited a strong attention effect, which implies that relative value and top-down attention engage overlapping, if not identical, neuronal selection mechanisms. Our findings demonstrate that the effects of reward value reach down to the earliest sensory processing levels of the cerebral cortex and imply that theories about the effects of reward coding and top-down attention on visual representations should be unified.},

This theoretical dichotomy, however, fails to explain a growing number of cases in which neither current goals nor physical salience can account for strong selection biases. For example, equally salient stimuli associated with reward can capture attention, even when this contradicts current selection goals. Thus, although 'top-down' sources of bias are sometimes defined as those that are not due to physical salience, this conception conflates distinct - and sometimes contradictory - sources of selection bias. We describe an alternative framework, in which past selection history is integrated with current goals and physical salience to shape an integrated priority map. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The nodal, neuronal, fast adaptation follows its relative anisotropic (dendritic) input timings, as indicated experimentally, similarly to the slow learning mechanism currently attributed to the links, synapses. It represents a non-local learning rule, where effectively many incoming links to a node concurrently undergo the same adaptation. The network dynamics is now counterintuitively governed by the weak links, which previously were assumed to be insignificant. This cooperative nonlinear dynamic adaptation presents a self-controlled mechanism to prevent divergence or vanishing of the learning parameters, as opposed to learning by links, and also supports self-oscillations of the effective learning parameters. It hints on a hierarchical computational complexity of nodes, following their number of anisotropic inputs and opens new horizons for advanced deep learning algorithms and artificial intelligence based applications, as well as a new mechanism for enhanced and fast learning by neural networks.},

Here we revisit the problem of supervised learning in temporally coding multi-layer spiking neural networks. First, by using a surrogate gradient approach, we derive SuperSpike, a nonlinear voltage-based three factor learning rule capable of training multi-layer networks of deterministic integrate-and-fire neurons to perform nonlinear computations on spatiotemporal spike patterns. Second, inspired by recent results on feedback alignment, we compare the performance of our learning rule under different credit assignment strategies for propagating output errors to hidden units. Specifically, we test uniform, symmetric and random feedback, finding that simpler tasks can be solved with any type of feedback, while more complex tasks require symmetric feedback. In summary, our results open the door to obtaining a better scientific understanding of learning and computation in spiking neural networks by advancing our ability to train them to solve nonlinear problems involving transformations between different spatiotemporal spike-time patterns.},

Here we present three types of experiments, using neuronal cultures, indicating that each neuron functions as a collection of independent threshold units. The neuron is anisotropically activated following the origin of the arriving signals to the membrane, via its dendritic trees. The first type of experiments demonstrates that a single neuron's spike waveform typically varies as a function of the stimulation location. The second type reveals that spatial summation is absent for extracellular stimulations from different directions. The third type indicates that spatial summation and subtraction are not achieved when combining intra- and extra- cellular stimulations, as well as for nonlocal time interference, where the precise timings of the stimulations are irrelevant.

  abstract = {In order to understand how the mammalian neocortex is performing computations, two things are necessary; we need to have a good understanding of the available neuronal processing units and mechanisms, and we need to gain a better understanding of how those mechanisms are combined to build functioning systems. Therefore, in recent years there is an increasing interest in how spiking neural networks (SNN) can be used to perform complex computations or solve pattern recognition tasks. However, it remains a challenging task to design SNNs which use biologically plausible mechanisms (especially for learning new patterns), since most such SNN architectures rely on training in a rate-based network and subsequent conversion to a SNN. We present a SNN for digit recognition which is based on mechanisms with increased biological plausibility, i.e., conductance-based instead of current-based synapses, spike-timing-dependent plasticity with time-dependent weight change, lateral inhibition, and an adaptive spiking threshold. Unlike most other systems, we do not use a teaching signal and do not present any class labels to the network. Using this unsupervised learning scheme, our architecture achieves 95\% accuracy on the MNIST benchmark, which is better than previous SNN implementations without supervision. The fact that we used no domain-specific knowledge points toward the general applicability of our network design. Also, the performance of our network scales well with the number of neurons used and shows similar performance for four different learning rules, indicating robustness of the full combination of mechanisms, which suggests applicability in heterogeneous biological neural networks.},

  title = {{{BindsNET}}: {{A}} Machine Learning-Oriented Spiking Neural Networks Library in {{Python}}},
  abstract = {The development of spiking neural network simulation software is a critical component enabling the modeling of neural systems and the development of biologically inspired algorithms. Existing software frameworks support a wide range of neural functionality, software abstraction levels, and hardware devices, yet are typically not suitable for rapid prototyping or application to problems in the domain of machine learning. In this paper, we describe a new Python package for the simulation of spiking neural networks, specifically geared towards machine learning and reinforcement learning. Our software, called BindsNET, enables rapid building and simulation of spiking networks and features user-friendly, concise syntax. BindsNET is built on top of the PyTorch deep neural networks library, enabling fast CPU and GPU computation for large spiking networks. The BindsNET framework can be adjusted to meet the needs of other existing computing and hardware environments, e.g., TensorFlow. We also provide an interface into the OpenAI gym library, allowing for training and evaluation of spiking networks on reinforcement learning problems. We argue that this package facilitates the use of spiking networks for large-scale machine learning experimentation, and show some simple examples of how we envision BindsNET can be used in practice.},

  doi = {10.1101/372888},
  abstract = {Visual attention dramatically improves subjects' ability to see and also modulates the responses of visual and oculomotor neurons. Despite hundreds of studies demonstrating the co-occurrence of behavioral and neuronal effects of attention (Carrasco, 2011), the relationship between neuronal modulations and improved performance remains unknown. There are three dominant hypotheses (Figure 1A): that attention 1) improves visual information coding (Reynolds and Chelazzi, 2004; Maunsell, 2015), 2) improves communication between visual and oculomotor brain areas (Fries, 2015), or 3) reduces uncontrolled fluctuations in the animals' cognitive state, thereby improving performance and rendering observed effects of attention on response variability as epiphenomena (Ecker et al., 2016). Here we show that none of these hypotheses account for observed perceptual improvements and we provide evidence for a novel hypothesis: that the well known effects of attention on firing rates and shared response variability in visual cortex reshape the representation of attended stimuli such that they more effectively drive downstream neurons and guide decisions without explicitly changing the weights relating sensory responses to downstream neurons or behavior (Figure 1B). We assessed each hypothesized mechanism by recording simultaneously from groups of neurons in two stages of visuomotor processing: area MT, which encodes motion information (Born and Bradley, 2005) and the superior colliculus (SC), where neuronal responses are either visual, oculomotor, or intermediate (Wurtz and Albano, 1980; Sparks, 1999; Gandhi and Katnani, 2011) and have been hypothesized to be involved in computing perceptual decisions (Horwitz and Newsome, 1999). Constraining our analyses by the animals' behavior and the simultaneous recordings from both areas allowed us to reject each prior hypothesis and greatly clarified the relationship between attention, neuronal responses and behavior. Our results suggest a path toward understanding the neural underpinnings of perception and cognition in health and disease by analyzing neuronal responses in ways that are constrained by behavior and interactions between brain areas.},

By constructing a simple dendritic neuron model, we 17 demonstrate that with multisynaptic connections, synaptic plasticity approximates a 18 sample-based Bayesian filtering algorithm known as particle filtering, and wiring plasticity 19 implements its resampling process. The derived synaptic plasticity rule accounts for many 20 experimental observations, including the dendritic position dependence of 21 spike-timing-dependent plasticity. The proposed framework is applicable to detailed single 22 neuron models, and also to recurrent circuit models. Our study provides a novel conceptual 23 framework for synaptic plasticity and rewiring.},

  abstract = {There is still much unknown regarding the computational role of inhibitory cells in the sensory cortex. While modeling studies could potentially shed light on the critical role played by inhibition in cortical computation, there is a gap between the simplicity of many models of sensory coding and the biological complexity of the inhibitory subpopulation. In particular, many models do not respect that inhibition must be implemented in a separate subpopulation, with those inhibitory interneurons having a diversity of tuning properties and characteristic E/I cell ratios. In this study we demonstrate a computational framework for implementing inhibition in dynamical systems models that better respects these biophysical observations about inhibitory interneurons. The main approach leverages recent work related to decomposing matrices into low-rank and sparse components via convex optimization, and explicitly exploits the fact that models and input statistics often have low-dimensional structure that can be exploited for efficient implementations. While this approach is applicable to a wide range of sensory coding models (including a family of models based on Bayesian inference in a linear generative model), for concreteness we demonstrate the approach on a network implementing sparse coding. We show that the resulting implementation stays faithful to the original coding goals while using inhibitory interneurons that are much more biophysically plausible.},

The stimuli were parametrically generated using a computer graphics morphing system (Sheltonelton, 2000) that allowed precise control over stimulus shape. After training, we recorded neural activity from the PFC and the ITC of monkeys while they performed a category-matching task. We found that the PFC and the ITC play distinct roles in category-based behaviors: the ITC seems more involved in the analysis of currently viewed shapes, whereas the PFC showed stronger category signals, memory effects, and a greater tendency to encode information in terms of its behavioral meaning.},

  abstract = {This article focuses on the interaction between the basal ganglia (BG) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). The BG are a group of nuclei at the base of the forebrain that are highly connected with cortex. A century of research suggests that the role of the BG is not exclusively motor, and that the BG also play an important role in learning and memory. In this review article, we argue that one important role of the BG is to train connections between posterior cortical areas and frontal cortical regions that are responsible for automatic behavior after extensive training. According to this view, one effect of BG trial-and-error learning is to activate the correct frontal areas shortly after posterior associative cortex activation, thus allowing for Hebbian learning of robust, fast, and efficient cortico-cortical processing. This hypothesized process is general, and the content of the learned associations depends on the specific areas involved (e.g., associations involving premotor areas would be more closely related to behavior than associations involving the PFC). We review experiments aimed at pinpointing the function of the BG and the frontal cortex and show that these results are consistent with the view that the BG is a general purpose trainer for cortico-cortical connections. We conclude with a discussion of some implications of the integrative framework and how this can help better understand the role of the BG in many different tasks.},

  abstract = {What are the computational tasks that an executive controller for visual attention must solve? This question is posed in the context of the Selective Tuning model of attention. The range of required computations go beyond top-down bias signals or region-of-interest determinations, and must deal with overt and covert fixations, process timing and synchronization, information routing, memory, matching control to task, spatial localization, priming, and coordination of bottom-up with top-down information. During task execution, results must be monitored to ensure the expected results. This description includes the kinds of elements that are common in the control of any kind of complex machine or system. We seek a mechanistic integration of the above, in other words, algorithms that accomplish control. Such algorithms operate on representations, transforming a representation of one kind into another, which then forms the input to yet another algorithm. Cognitive Programs (CPs) are hypothesized to capture exactly such representational transformations via stepwise sequences of operations. CPs, an updated and modernized offspring of Ullman's Visual Routines, impose an algorithmic structure to the set of attentional functions and play a role in the overall shaping of attentional modulation of the visual system so that it provides its best performance. This requires that we consider the visual system as a dynamic, yet general-purpose processor tuned to the task and input of the moment. This differs dramatically from the almost universal cognitive and computational views, which regard vision as a passively observing module to which simple questions about percepts can be posed, regardless of task. Differing from Visual Routines, CPs explicitly involve the critical elements of Visual Task Executive (vTE), Visual Attention Executive (vAE), and Visual Working Memory (vWM). Cognitive Programs provide the software that directs the actions of the Selective Tuning model of visual attention.},

It has been suggested that eye movements may be guided by activity in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP), which is thought to represent the relative value of objects in space. However, it is not clear how values for saccade goal selection are prioritized while free-viewing in a cluttered visual environment. To address this question, we compared the neural responses of LIP neurons in two subjects with their saccadic behavior and three estimates of stimulus value. These measures were extracted from the subjects' performance in a visual foraging task, in which we parametrically controlled the number of objects on the screen. We found that the firing rates of LIP neurons did not correlate well with the animals' behavior or any of our estimated measures of value. However, if the LIP activity was further normalized, it became highly correlated with the animals' decisions. These data suggest that LIP activity does not represent value in complex environments, but that the value can easily be extracted with one further step of processing. We propose that activity in LIP represents attentional priority and that the downstream normalization of this activity is an essential process in guiding action.},

  abstract = {We present a biologically plausible model of an attentional mechanism for forming position-and scale-invariant repre-sentations of objects in the visual world. The model relies on a set of control neurons to dynamically modify the syn-aptic strengths of intracortical connections so that information from a windowed region of primary visual cortex (VI) is selectively routed to higher cortical areas. Local spatial re-lationships (i.e., topography) within the attentional window are preserved as information is routed through the cortex. This enables attended objects to be represented in higher cortical areas within an object-centered reference frame that is position and scale invariant. We hypothesize that the pul-vinar may provide the control signals for routing information through the cortex. The dynamics of the control neurons are governed by simple differential equations that could be re-alized by neurobiologically plausible circuits. In preattentive mode, the control neurons receive their input from a low-level " saliency map " representing potentially interesting regions of a scene. During the pattern recognition phase, control neurons are driven by the interaction between top-down (memory) and bottom-up (retinal input) sources. The model respects key neurophysiological, neuroanatomical, and psychophysical data relating to attention, and it makes a variety of experimentally testable predictions. Of all the visual tasks humans can perform, pattern recognition is arguably the most computationally difficult. This can be at-tributed primarily to two major factors. The first is that in order to recognize a particular object, the brain must go through a matching process to determine which of the countless objects it has seen before best matches a particular object under scrutiny. The second factor is that any particular object can appear at different positions, sizes, and orientations on the retina, thus giving rise to very different neural representations at early stages of the visual system.},

We tested the neurons for visual responses to stationary and moving stimuli and for changes in these responses produced by behavioral manipulations. All areas contain cells sensitive to stimulus orientation as well as neurons selective for the direction of stimulus movement; however, the majority of cells in all three regions are either broadly tuned or nonselective for these attributes. Nearly all cells respond to stimulus onset, a significant number also give a response to stimulus termination, and rarely a cell gives only off responses. Nearly all cells increase their discharge rate to visual stimuli. Receptive fields in the two retinotopically mapped regions, PI and PL, have well-defined borders. The sizes of these receptive fields show a positive correlation with the eccentricity of the receptive fields. The receptive fields in the remaining region, Pdm, are frequently very large, but with these large fields excluded, show a similar correlation with eccentricity. All pulvinar cells tested (n = 20) were mapped in retinal coordinates; the receptive fields are positioned in relation to the retina. We found no cells with gaze-gated characteristics (2), nor cells mapped in a spatial coordinate system. The response latencies in PI and PL are shorter and less variable than the latencies in Pdm. Active use of a stimulus can produce an enhancement or attenuation of the visual response. Eye-movement modulation was found in all three subdivisions in about equal frequencies. Attentional modulation was common in Pdm and was rare in PI and PL. The modulation is spatially selective in Pdm and nonselective in PI for a small number of tested cells. These data demonstrate functional differences between Pdm and the other two areas and suggest that Pdm plays a role in selective visual attention, whereas PI and PL probably contribute to other aspects of visual perception.},

  abstract = {The notion of gating as a mechanism capable of controlling the flow of information from one set of neurons to another, has been studied in many regions of the central nervous system. In the nucleus accumbens, where evidence is especially clear, gating seems to rely on the action of bistable neurons, i.e., of neurons that oscillate between a quiescent "down" state and a firing "up" state, and that act as AND-gates relative to their entries. Independently from these observations, a growing body of evidence now indicates that bistable neurons are also quite abundant in the cortex, although their exact functions in the dynamics of the brain remain to be determined. Here, we propose that at least some of these bistable cortical neurons are part of circuits devoted to gating information flow within the cortex. We also suggest that currently available structural, electrophysiological, and imaging data support the existence of at least three different types of gating architectures. The first architecture involves gating directly by the cortex itself. The second architecture features circuits spanning the cortex and the thalamus. The third architecture extends itself through the cortex, the basal ganglia, and the thalamus. These propositions highlight the variety of mechanisms that could regulate the passage of action potentials between cortical neurons sets. They also suggest that gating mechanisms require larger-scale neural circuitry to control the state of the gates themselves, in order to fit in the overall wiring of the brain and complement its dynamics.},

The generic properties of signal selection are defined and neural networks for this type of computation examined. A comparison between these networks and basal ganglia anatomy leads to a novel functional decomposition of the basal ganglia architecture into 'selection' and 'control' pathways. The former pathway performs the selection per se via a feedforward off-centre on-surround network. The control pathway regulates the action of the selection pathway to ensure its effective operation, and synergistically complements its dopaminergic modulation. The model contrasts with the prevailing functional segregation of basal ganglia into 'direct' and 'indirect' pathways.},

First, several elegant features are exposed--capacity scaling, enhanced selectivity and synergistic dopamine modulation--which might be expected to exist in a well designed action selection mechanism. The discovery of these features also lends support to the computational premise of selection that underpins our model. Second, good matches between model globus pallidus external segment output and globus pallidus internal segment and substantia nigra reticulata area output, and neurophysiological data, have been found which are indicative of common architectural features in the model and biological basal ganglia.

In order to correct these errors, we need a new technical vocabulary that allows for attentional effects to be continuously distributed, rather than merely present or absent, and that provides a basis for quantitative behavioral predictions that map onto neural substrates. The terminology of the Bayesian Decision Process has already proved useful for structuring conceptual discussions in other psychological domains, such as perception and decision making under uncertainty, and it had demonstrated early success in the domain of attention. By rejecting a reified, causal conception of attention, in favor of theories that produce attentional effects as consequences, psychologists will be able to conduct more definitive experiments. Such conceptual advances will then enhance the productivity of neuroscientists by allowing them to concentrate their data collection efforts on the richest soil.},

Other work has shown that sensory normalization mechanisms are important for explaining many aspects of how visual representations change with atten- tion, and these mechanisms must be taken into account when evaluating attention-related neuronal modulations. Studies comparing different brain structures suggest that attention is composed of several cognitive processes, which might be controlled by different brain regions.

In each trial, participants viewed a stimulus, indicated their prediction via a button press, and then received feedback. Conditions were defined on the bases of stimulus-outcome contingency (deterministic, probabilistic, and random) and feedback (negative and positive). A region of interest analysis was used to examine activity in the head of the caudate, body/tail of the caudate, and putamen. Activity associated with successful learning was localized in the body and tail of the caudate and putamen; this activity increased as the stimulus-outcome contingencies were learned. In contrast, activity in the head of the caudate and ventral striatum was associated most strongly with processing feedback and decreased across trials. The left superior frontal gyrus was more active for deterministic than probabilistic stimuli; conversely, extrastriate visual areas were more active for probabilistic than deterministic stimuli. Overall, hippocampal activity was associated with receiving positive feedback but not with correct classification. Successful learning correlated positively with activity in the body and tail of the caudate nucleus and negatively with activity in the hippocampus.},

To understand its neural basis, we simultaneously recorded from multiple electrodes in lateral prefrontal cortex and dorsal striatum, two interconnected brain structures critical for learning. Each day, monkeys learned to associate novel abstract, dot-based categories with a right versus left saccade. Early on, when they could acquire specific stimulus-response associations, striatum activity was an earlier predictor of the corresponding saccade. However, as the number of exemplars increased and monkeys had to learn to classify them, PFC activity began to predict the saccade associated with each category before the striatum. While monkeys were categorizing novel exemplars at a high rate, PFC activity was a strong predictor of their corresponding saccade early in the trial before the striatal neurons. These results suggest that striatum plays a greater role in stimulus-response association and PFC in abstraction of categories. Video Abstract: \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {In Parkinson's disease, a loss of dopamine neurons causes severe motor impairments. These motor impairments have long been thought to result exclusively from immediate effects of dopamine loss on neuronal firing in basal ganglia, causing imbalances of basal ganglia pathways. However, motor impairments and pathway imbalances may also result from dysfunctional synaptic plasticity - a novel concept of how Parkinsonian symptoms evolve. Here we built a neuro-computational model that allows us to simulate the effects of dopamine loss on synaptic plasticity in basal ganglia. Our simulations confirm that dysfunctional synaptic plasticity can indeed explain the emergence of both motor impairments and pathway imbalances in Parkinson's disease, thus corroborating the novel concept. By predicting that dysfunctional plasticity results not only in reduced activation of desired responses, but also in their active inhibition, our simulations provide novel testable predictions. When simulating dopamine replacement therapy (which is a standard treatment in clinical practice), we observe a new balance of pathway outputs, rather than a simple restoration of non-Parkinsonian states. In addition, high doses of replacement are shown to result in overshooting motor activity, in line with empirical evidence. Finally, our simulations provide an explanation for the intensely debated paradox that focused basal ganglia lesions alleviate Parkinsonian symptoms, but do not impair performance in healthy animals. Overall, our simulations suggest that the effects of dopamine loss on synaptic plasticity play an essential role in the development of Parkinsonian symptoms, thus arguing for a re-conceptualisation of Parkinsonian pathophysiology.},

It is subserved by plasticity in many neural systems, including neocortical regions (sensory, prefrontal, parietal, and motor cortex), the medial temporal lobe, the basal ganglia, and midbrain dopaminergic systems. These systems interact during category learning. Corticostriatal loops may mediate recursive, bootstrapping interactions between fast reward-gated plasticity in the basal ganglia and slow reward-shaded plasticity in the cortex. This can provide a balance between acquisition of details of experiences and generalization across them. Interactions between the corticostriatal loops can integrate perceptual, response, and feedback-related aspects of the task and mediate the shift from novice to skilled performance. The basal ganglia and medial temporal lobe interact competitively or cooperatively, depending on the demands of the learning task.},

The animal had to detect the repetition of a visual pattern (i.e. detect similarity), preceded by a randomized number of alternations between two different patterns. The responses produced by the last, reward contingent stimulus were compared with responses obtained to that same stimulus earlier in the sequence. Modulatory effects in V1 were moderate: 31\% of the cells (63 of 200) showed response increments of 20\% or more to the last, reward contingent stimulus. In V4 the effects were much more pronounced: 72\% of the cells (110 of 154) showed modulatory effects of more than 20\%. In V4 but not in V1 orientation tuning curves showed a significant narrowing as well as a peak response increment to the behaviorally salient stimulus, suggesting a feature specific mechanism associated with the detection of similarity. Although a response decrement was observed in many cells during the repeated alternations, this effect was significantly smaller than the modulation produced by the detection of similarity. Controls included the presentation of novel stimuli during the presentation sequence which did not produce an enhanced response. It is hypothesized that the feature specific effects reported here are produced by higher order feedback systems.},

In each trial the animal was first cued with randomly selected orientation, and then presented with a sequence of gratings whose orientations were randomly selected. The animal was required to release a switch when it saw a grating that matched the cued orientation. For some recordings the animal was given a tactile cue by having it feel the orientation of a grooved plate that it could not see. In other experiments the cue orientation was presented visually on the screen in front of the animal and then removed before the sequence of gratings was presented. Using this task it was possible to determine if a neuron's response to a particular orientation was affected by whether or not it was the orientation for which the animal was looking. Over half the neurons examined in V4 (110/192) responded differently to the visual stimuli when the animal was cued to look for different orientations. For some neurons responses to all stimuli were strong when the animal was cued to look for a particular orientation, but weak when the same stimuli were presented in trials where the animal had been cued to look for another orientation. This type of sensitivity was found in neurons recorded while the animal was given a tactile cue, and also in other neurons tested when a visual cue was used, suggesting that the activity was not of direct sensory origin. In support of this, neurons in V4 were not strongly affected when the animal felt the grooved plate while not performing the orientation matching task. The prevalence of behavioral effects that was found using the orientation matching task suggests that extraretinal signals represent a prominent component of the activity in V4 of the behaving monkey.},

We show that the standard statistical methods that were used to identify action-value neurons in the striatum erroneously detect the same action-value representations in unrelated neuronal recordings. This is due to temporal correlations in the neuronal data. We propose an alternative statistical method for identifying action-value representations that is not subject to this caveat. We apply it to previously identified action-value neurons in the basal ganglia and fail to detect action-value representations. In conclusion, we argue that there is no conclusive evidence for the generally accepted hypothesis that striatal neurons encode action-values.},

Dendrites are endowed with mechanisms of nonlinear summation of synaptic inputs leading to regenerative dendritic events including local sodium, NMDA and calcium spikes. The generation of these events requires distinct spatio-temporal activation patterns of synaptic inputs. We hypothesise that the recent findings on dendritic spikes and local synaptic plasticity rules suggest clustering of common inputs along a subregion of a dendritic branch. These clusters may enable dendrites to separately threshold groups of functionally similar inputs, thus allowing single neurons to act as a superposition of many separate integrate and fire units. Ultimately, these properties expand our understanding about the computational power of neuronal networks. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Local supra-linear summation of excitatory inputs occurring in pyramidal cell dendrites, the so-called dendritic spikes, results in independent spiking dendritic sub-units, which turn pyramidal neurons into two-layer neural networks capable of computing linearly non-separable functions, such as the exclusive OR. Other neuron classes, such as interneurons, may possess only a few independent dendritic sub-units, or only passive dendrites where input summation is purely sub-linear, and where dendritic sub-units are only saturating. To determine if such neurons can also compute linearly non-separable functions, we enumerate, for a given parameter range, the Boolean functions implementable by a binary neuron model with a linear sub-unit and either a single spiking or a saturating dendritic sub-unit. We then analytically generalize these numerical results to an arbitrary number of non-linear sub-units. First, we show that a single non-linear dendritic sub-unit, in addition to the somatic non-linearity, is sufficient to compute linearly non-separable functions. Second, we analytically prove that, with a sufficient number of saturating dendritic sub-units, a neuron can compute all functions computable with purely excitatory inputs. Third, we show that these linearly non-separable functions can be implemented with at least two strategies: one where a dendritic sub-unit is sufficient to trigger a somatic spike; another where somatic spiking requires the cooperation of multiple dendritic sub-units. We formally prove that implementing the latter architecture is possible with both types of dendritic sub-units whereas the former is only possible with spiking dendrites. Finally, we show how linearly non-separable functions can be computed by a generic two-compartment biophysical model and a realistic neuron model of the cerebellar stellate cell interneuron. Taken together our results demonstrate that passive dendrites are sufficient to enable neurons to compute linearly non-separable functions.},

This convex optimization problem aims to estimate an inverse covariance matrix that can be decomposed into a sparse matrix minus a low-rank matrix from sample data. Solving this convex optimization problem is very challenging, especially for large problems. In this paper, we propose two alternating direction methods for solving this problem. The first method is to apply the classical alternating direction method of multipliers to solve the problem as a consensus problem. The second method is a proximal gradient based alternating direction method of multipliers. Our methods exploit and take advantage of the special structure of the problem and thus can solve large problems very efficiently. Global convergence result is established for the proposed methods. Numerical results on both synthetic data and gene expression data show that our methods usually solve problems with one million variables in one to two minutes, and are usually five to thirty five times faster than a state-of-the-art Newton-CG proximal point algorithm.},

Previous studies have most often reported global linear or sublinear summation. An alternative view, supported by biophysical modeling studies, holds that thin dendrites provide a layer of independent computational 'subunits' that sigmoidally modulate their inputs prior to global summation. To distinguish these possibilities, we combined confocal imaging and dual-site focal synaptic stimulation of identified thin dendrites in rat neocortical pyramidal neurons. We found that nearby inputs on the same branch summed sigmoidally, whereas widely separated inputs or inputs to different branches summed linearly. This strong spatial compartmentalization effect is incompatible with a global summation rule and provides the first experimental support for a two-layer 'neural network' model of pyramidal neuron thin-branch integration. Our findings could have important implications for the computing and memory-related functions of cortical tissue.},

We found that subjects only learned stimulus-response mappings for attended shapes, even when unattended shapes were equally informative. Reward magnitude also influenced learning, an effect that was stronger for attended than for non-attended shapes and that carried over to a subsequent visual search task. Our results provide insights into how attention and reward jointly determine how we learn.

Specifically, the processing of visual motion serves as a model system to study how attention shapes the spatial selectivity of single neurons and how this change in spatial tuning might influence the perception of spatial relations. The thesis' main part consists of two related studies in which single-cell recordings from the medial temporal area (MT) of awake behaving macaques were used to investigate attentional modulation of receptive field profiles (spatial selectivity profiles), one computational study in which these effects were modeled, and one psychophysical experiment with human subjects in which predictions from the physiological results were tested.  ===========================  Psychophysik und Physiologie von Aufmerksamkeitseinfl\"ussen auf die Verarbeitung visueller Bewegung  Die Wahrnehmung liefert keine objektive Repr\"asentation der sensorischen Information sondern wird durch den aktuellen Zustand des Organismus beeinflusst.

Recent research in human and nonhuman primates has begun to reveal how reward can bias attentional selection, and where within the cognitive system the signals providing attentional priority are generated.

This model incorporates a broad range of biological features that pose challenges to neural RL, such as temporally extended action sequences, continuous environments involving unknown time delays, and noisy/imprecise computations. Most significantly, we expand the model into the realm of hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), which divides the RL process into a hierarchy of actions at different levels of abstraction. Here we implement all the major components of HRL in a neural model that captures a variety of known anatomical and physiological properties of the brain. We demonstrate the performance of the model in a range of different environments, in order to emphasize the aim of understanding the brain's general reinforcement learning ability. These results show that the model compares well to previous modelling work and demonstrates improved performance as a result of its hierarchical ability. We also show that the model's behaviour is consistent with available data on human hierarchical RL, and generate several novel predictions.},

  abstract = {The theory of artificial neural networks has been successfully applied to a wide variety of pattern recognition problems. In this paper we introduce a novel class of neural networks, called morphological neural networks, in which the operations of multiplication and addition are replaced by addition and maximum (or minimum), respectively. By taking the maximum (or minimum) of sums instead of the sum of products, morphological network computation is nonlinear before thresholding. As a consequence, the properties of morphological neural networks are drastically different than those of traditional neural network models. In this paper we consider some of these differences and examine the computing capabilities of morphological neural networks. As particular examples of a morphological neural network we discuss morphological associative memories and morphological perceptrons},

  abstract = {Dendrite morphological neurons are a type of artificial neural network that works with min and max operators instead of algebraic products. These morphological operators build hyperboxes in N-dimensional space. These hyperboxes allow the proposal of training methods based on heuristics without using an optimisation method. In literature, it has been claimed that these heuristic-based trainings have advantages: there are no convergence problems, perfect classification can always be reached and training is performed in only one epoch. In this paper, we show that these assumed advantages come with a cost: these heuristics increase classification errors in the test set because they are not optimal and learning generalisation is poor. To solve these problems, we introduce a novel method to train dendrite morphological neurons based on stochastic gradient descent for classification tasks, using these heuristics just for initialisation of learning parameters. Experiments show that we can enhance the testing error in comparison with solely heuristic-based training methods. This approach can reach competitive performance with respect to other popular machine learning algorithms.},

Models of plastic networks typically combine point neurons with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) as the learning rule. However, a point neuron does not capture the local non-linear processing of synaptic inputs allowed for by dendrites. Furthermore, experimental evidence suggests that STDP is not the only learning rule available to neurons. By implementing biophysically realistic neuron models, we study how dendrites enable multiple synaptic plasticity mechanisms to coexist in a single cell. In these models, we compare the conditions for STDP and for synaptic strengthening by local dendritic spikes. We also explore how the connectivity between two cells is affected by these plasticity rules and by different synaptic distributions. Finally, we show that how memory retention during associative learning can be prolonged in networks of neurons by including dendrites.},

  abstract = {The neuronal and synaptic organisation of the cerebral cortex appears exceedingly complex, and the definition of a basic cortical circuit in terms of defined classes of cells and connections is necessary to facilitate progress of its analysis. During the last two decades quantitative studies of the synaptic connectivity of identified cortical neurones and their molecular dissection revealed a number of general rules that apply to all areas of cortex. In this review, first the precise location of postsynaptic GABA and glutamate receptors is examined at conical synapses, in order to define the site of synaptic interactions. It is argued that, due to the exclusion of G protein-coupled receptors from the postsynaptic density, the presence of extrasynaptic receptors and the molecular compartmentalisation of the postsynaptic membrane, the synapse should include membrane areas beyond the membrane specialisation. Subsequently, the following organisational principles are examined: 1. The cerebral cortex consists of: (i) a large population of principal neurones reciprocally connected to the thalamus and to each other via axon collaterals releasing excitatory amino acids, and, (ii) a smaller population of mainly local circuit GABAergic neurones. 2. Differential reciprocal connections are also formed amongst GABAergic neurones. 3. All extrinsic and intracortical glutamatergic pathways terminate on both the principal and the GABAergic neurones, differentially weighted according to the pathway. 4. Synapses of multiple sets of glutamatergic and GABAergic afferents subdivide the surface of cortical neurones and are often co-aligned on the dendritic domain. 5. A unique feature of the cortex is the GABAergic axo-axonic cell, influencing principal cells through GABA(A) receptors at synapses located exclusively on the axon initial segment. The analysis of these salient features of connectivity has revealed a remarkably selective array of connections, yet a highly adaptable design of the basic circuit emerges when comparisons are made between cortical areas or layers. The basic circuit is most obvious in the hippocampus where a relatively homogeneous set of spatially aligned principal cells allows an easy visualization of the organisational rules. Those principles which have been examined in the isocortex proved to be identical or very similar. In the isocortex, the basic circuit, scaled to specific requirements, is repeated in each layer. As multiple sets of output neurones evolved, requiring subtly different needs for their inputs, the basic circuit may be superimposed several times in the same layer. Tangential intralaminar connections in both the hippocampus and isocortex also connect output neurones with similar properties, as best seen in the patchy connections in the isocortex. The additional radial superposition of several laminae of distinct sets of output neurones, each representing and supported by its basic circuit, requires a co-ordination of their activity that is mediated by highly selective interlaminar connections, involving both the GABAergic and the excitatory amino acid releasing neurones. The remarkable specificity in the geometry of cells and the selectivity in placement of neurotransmitter receptors and synapses on their surface, strongly suggest a predominant role for time in the coding of information, but this does not exclude an important role also for the rate of action potential discharge in cortical representation of information.},

Here we develop a biologically plausible learning scheme that explains how trial-and-error learning induces neuronal selectivity and working memory representations for task-relevant information. We propose that the response selection stage sends attentional feedback signals to earlier processing levels, forming synaptic tags at those connections responsible for the stimulus-response mapping. Globally released neuromodulators then interact with tagged synapses to determine their plasticity. The resulting learning rule endows neural networks with the capacity to create new working memory representations of task relevant information as persistent activity. It is remarkably generic: it explains how association neurons learn to store task-relevant information for linear as well as non-linear stimulus-response mappings, how they become tuned to category boundaries or analog variables, depending on the task demands, and how they learn to integrate probabilistic evidence for perceptual decisions.},

Specifically, we hypothesize that a mechanism capable of quantifying and controlling the evolution of the information flow between the agent and the environment could be the fundamental component for implementing a higher degree of autonomy into artificial intelligent agents. This paper propose a unified strategy for implementing two semantically orthogonal intrinsic motivations: curiosity and empowerment. Curiosity reward informs the agent about the relevance of a recent agent action, whereas empowerment is implemented as the opposite information flow from the agent to the environment that quantifies the agent's potential of controlling its own future. We show that an additional homeostatic drive is derived from the curiosity reward, which generalizes and enhances the information gain of a classical curious/heterostatic reinforcement learning agent. We show how a shared internal model by curiosity and empowerment facilitates a more efficient training of the empowerment function. Finally, we discuss future directions for further leveraging the interplay between these two intrinsic rewards.},

Like neocortical pyramidal neurons, neurons in our model receive sensory information and higher-order feedback in electrotonically segregated compartments. Thanks to this segregation, the neurons in different layers of the network can coordinate synaptic weight updates. As a result, the network can learn to categorize images better than a single layer network. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm takes advantage of multilayer architectures to identify useful representations---the hallmark of deep learning. This work demonstrates that deep learning can be achieved using segregated dendritic compartments, which may help to explain the dendritic morphology of neocortical pyramidal neurons.},

We found that, in terms of cortical activations, engagement of the dorsal fronto-parietal network by goal-directed attention did not depend on oculomotor requirements, being found similarly for covert attention, in accord with other work. However, analyses of effective connectivity (or "functional coupling") revealed that information flow within this network changed significantly as a function of both the task (goal-directed or stimulus-driven) and the overt versus covert form of attention. Additionally, we observed a distinct set of subcortical regions (pulvinar and caudate nucleus) engaged primarily during the covert form of goal-directed search.

Dopamine signaling within the ventral striatum plays an important role in reward learning, representing the expected reward initiated by a cue [13, 14]. How dopamine and the striatum may be involved in maintaining behaviors that have been shaped by reward learning, even after reward expectancies have changed, is less well understood [15]. Nonspecific measures of brain activity have implicated the striatum in value-based attention [11, 12, 16-18]. However, the neurochemical mechanisms underlying the attentional priority of learned reward cues remain unexplored. Here, we investigated the contribution of dopamine to value-based attention using positron emission tomography (PET) with [11C]raclopride. We show that, in the explicit absence of reward, the magnitude of attentional capture by previously reward-associated but currently task-irrelevant distractors is correlated across individuals with changes in available D2/D3 dopamine receptors (presumably due to intrasynaptic dopamine) linked to distractor processing within the right caudate and posterior putamen. Our findings provide direct evidence linking dopamine signaling within the striatum to the involuntary orienting of attention, and specifically to the attention-grabbing quality of learned reward cues. These findings also shed light on the neurochemical basis of individual susceptibility to value-driven attentional capture, which is known to play a role in addiction [19-21]. More broadly, the present study highlights the value and feasibility of using PET to relate changes in the release of a neurotransmitter to learning-dependent changes in healthy adults.},

  abstract = {s0010 INTRODUCTION p0010 In recent years, an extensive literature stemming from the study of learning in animal models has begun to elucidate the mechanisms that underpin goal-directed behavior (Dolan \& Dayan, 2013). This conceptual framework distinguishes two types of " instrumental " learning, or ways in which actions can be facilitated based on their result-ing rewards or punishments. A " goal-directed " action is a behavior driven by an expec-tation that it is likely to bring about a desired outcome (Dickinson, 1985). Goal-directed decisions leverage causal knowledge of the potential consequences of actions to flexibly pursue a current goal. Such deliberate action selection is distinguished from " habitual " behavior, in which an action is reflexively elicited by the cues or contexts associated with its prior successful performance. Whereas goal-directed actions are selected based on expectations of their consequent outcomes, habits are thought to stem from the for-mation of stimuluseresponse associations, reinforced by reward and automatically elicited by their antecedent stimuli. p0015 This distinction between two types of instrumental action has its origins in a historic scientific debate. The dominant behaviorist account of instrumental behavior in the early 20th century proposed that instrumental action reflected an assembly of stimuluse response associations, stamped in through reinforcement, and reflexively elicited by envi-ronmental cues or contexts. In the mid-20th century Edward Tolman advocated for an alternative view, proposing instead that animals and humans form mental models of their environments (cognitive models or " maps ") that can be flexibly consulted and recruited to pursue a current goal (Tolman, 1948). In the ensuing decades, a large interdisciplinary empirical literature has provided support for this conceptualization of goal-directed learning. Behavioral tasks have been designed to test for the key features of goal-directed behavior and examine the experimental factors that influence the balance between goal-directed versus habitual action (Dickinson, 1985). Convergent computa-tional, psychological, and neuroscientific literature have begun to characterize the diverse algorithmic, cognitive, and neurobiological processes that enable goal-directed action},

Recent experiments by Mountcastle and colleagues colleagues (41, 48, 49) have described cells in posterior parietal cortex of the rhesus monkey (area 7) that discharge in association with eye movements and hand movements. We have studied the activity of cells in area 7 during visually guided saccadic eye movements, visual fixations, smooth-pursuit eye movements, and visually guided hand projection movements. We have found that any cell that fires in association with a movement can be driven by a passive sensory stimulus, one delivered in the absence of movement. Frequently the identical stimulus that evokes the movement is adequate. Although we have classified neurons according to the movements with which they can be associated, we propose that such a classification be abandoned, and that parietal cells, which have sensory responses, be described according to these sensory properties. 2. "Saccade neurons" discharge prior to visually guided saccadic eye movements. They never fire before comparable saccadic eye movements made in the absence of a proper stimulus. These cells can inevitably be driven by the onset of a visual stimulus, usually the target for the eye movement. 3. For about half of the saccade neurons, the response to a stimulus is enhanced when the light is going to be the target for a saccadic eye movement. The enhancement is selective for eye movements into the visual receptive field and does not occur with eye movements to other points outside of the visual receptive field. Since small spots of light can be poor stimuli for these cells, some will only respond clearly to our saccade tar- gets in this enhanced condition. Such cells  inevitably respond to passive stimuli, which  are large.4. "Visual fixation neurons" fire tonicallywhile the monkey gazes at a target light.  There are two classes of such cells: those  with limited gaze fields and those with full  gaze fields. "Limited gaze field neurons"  discharge when the animal looks at a target light in some, but not in all directions. The  cells fire briskly in response to proper pas-sive visual stimuli, even when the animal  looks in a nonpreferred direction. It is, there-  fore, probable that these neurons with tonic  visual responses become active when the direction of gaze results in stimulation of  the receptive field by some visual contour  of the experimental environment.  5. Visual fixation neurons with full gaze fields fire whenever the animal fixates the target light. All of these cells have foveal  receptive fields and tonic responses. Visual properties can be demonstrated by changing the intensity of the fixation point in a situa-tion in which the animal's fixation remainsunchanged. The neuronal response follows the fixation point intensity.  6. "Tracking neurons" become active while the monkey pursues a spot of light moving slowly in one direction, but are in-  active or suppressed with tracking eye move- ments in the opposite direction. These neurons have directionally selective responsesto stimuli moving while the animal fixates. The visual fields may include the fovea aswell as large parts of the peripheral visualfield. 7. "Hand projection neurons" discharge prior to visually guided reaching movements and are responsive to passive visual and/or somatosensory stimulation. A subset of hand projection cells are bimodal, responding to passive visual and somatosensory stimuli.  The visual and somatosensory receptive fields large and frequently bilateral. 8. Parietal neurons with visual responses have large receptive fields that usually cover I the contralateral visual field and may in- clude the fovea. Some cells have a bilateral representation, whereas others have exclu- sively ipsilateral fields. The cells are not fas- tidious about stimulus shape, orientation, color, or direction of movement. In general, they respond best to large, bright stimuli. They have long latencies, the average being  100- 120 ms from the onset of a static stim- ulus. 9. We conclude that posterior parietal cor- tex is composed of neurons with sensory  responses, some of which associate infor- mation from the visual and somatosensory environment with internal data. Parieta! neu- rons respond to sensory stimulation in the absence of movement, but do not fire in as- sociation with movement in the absence of a stimulus. When a light is the target for a movement, the sensory response can be en- hanced. Nonetheless, for all parietal neu- rons, discharge is indicative of the presence of a stimulus and not predictive of move- rnent. Our data do not support the claim  that these neurons perform a "command func-  tion." We suggest that posterior parietal  cortex is related to visual attention; in this context it is related to movement but dis- sociable from it.},

Areas V4 and the inferior temporal cortex are involved in aspects of selective attention driven by the spatial location of the attended object, features of objects, the relevance of a stimulus to a particular task, and the amount of sustained attention required to perform a task. The superior temporal polysensory area (STPa) is an area usually thought of as a component of the temporal processing stream. However, data suggest that area STPa may decode the direction of others' attention, a function that requires the region to access information from both of the major corticocortical processing streams.

  doi = {10.1152/jn.00564.2001},
  abstract = {The centre m\'edian-parafascicular (CM-Pf) complex is located at the posterior intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus and forms part of the nonspecific thalamocortical projection system and the internal circuit of the basal ganglia. However, the functional roles of this complex remain to be fully elucidated. Here we have examined whether the CM-Pf complex is involved in the process of covert attention. We trained two macaque monkeys to perform a task in which a visual target stimulus for button release appeared at either the same location as the preceding visual instruction cue (a "validly cued target") or a location on the opposite side (an "invalidly cued target"). Reaction times (RTs) to a validly cued target were significantly shorter than those to an invalidly cued target, leading to a "validity effect" of about 20 ms. We recorded the activity of 97 neurons in the CM-Pf while the monkeys performed the attention task with the hand that was contralateral to the neuronal recording. Seventy CM-Pf neurons showed task-related activity after the appearance of either the instruction cue or the target stimulus: 33 neurons responded with a prominent short-latency facilitation (SLF), whereas 37 responded with a short-latency suppression followed by a long-latency facilitation (LLF). Most of the SLF neurons responded preferentially to a cue appearing on the contralateral side (76\%) and to an invalidly cued target appearing on the contralateral side (61\%). In contrast, LLF neurons showed a short-latency suppression after the cue stimulus, regardless of whether the cue appeared on the contra- or ipsilateral side (84\%). Inactivating the CM-Pf complex by local injection (1 microl) of the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol (1-5 microg/microl) resulted in a significant increase in the RT to a validly cued target presented on the contra- but not the ipsilateral side. In contrast, inactivating the CM-Pf complex did not affect RTs to invalidly cued targets on either the contra- or the ipsilateral side. Thus the validity effect was abolished only on the contralateral side. We conclude that the CM-Pf complex plays a specific and essential role in the process of attentional orienting to external events occurring on the contralateral side, probably through the projection of primary outputs to the striatum, which is involved in the action-selection mechanisms of the basal ganglia.},

  abstract = {The way the cognitive system scans the visual environment for relevant information~\textendash{}~visual search in short~\textendash{}~has been a long-standing central topic in vision science. From its inception as a research topic, and despite a number of promising alternative perspectives, the study of visual search has been governed by the assumption that a search proceeds on the basis of individual items (whether processed in parallel or not). This has led to the additional assumptions that shallow search slopes (at most a few tens of milliseconds per item for target-present trials) are most informative about the underlying process, and that eye movements are an epiphenomenon that can be safely ignored. We argue that the evidence now overwhelmingly favours an approach that takes fixations, not individual items, as its central unit. Within fixations, items are processed in parallel, and the functional field of view determines how many fixations are needed. In this type of theoretical framework, there is a direct connection between target discrimination difficulty, fixations, and reaction time (RT) measures. It therefore promises a more fundamental understanding of visual search by offering a unified account of both eye movement and manual response behaviour across the entire range of observed search efficiency, and provides new directions for research. A high-level conceptual simulation with just one free and four fixed parameters shows the viability of this approach.},

  abstract = {Fueled by innovation in the computer vision and artificial intelligence communities, recent developments in computational neuroscience have used goal-driven hierarchical convolutional neural networks (HCNNs) to make strides in modeling neural single-unit and population responses in higher visual cortical areas. In this Perspective, we review the recent progress in a broader modeling context and describe some of the key technical innovations that have supported it. We then outline how the goal-driven HCNN approach can be used to delve even more deeply into understanding the development and organization of sensory cortical processing.},
